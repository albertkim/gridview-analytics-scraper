    "title": "Funding extended to support people experiencing homelessness in Duncan",
    "contents": "DUNCAN – More than 30 people experiencing homelessness in Duncan will continue to have access to safe homes with supports as the Province, through BC Housing, has extended operating funding for The Village until 2027.  “The Village has been a tremendous success in Duncan, and we are proud to help ensure its residents can continue to stay in their homes, while we work to open more permanent housing in the community,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “Homelessness is not a problem that can be easily solved, which is why we will continue to explore unique and innovative initiatives like The Village to support B.C.’s most vulnerable people.”The Village is a temporary supportive housing site with 34 individual sleeping units at 610 Trunk Rd. in Duncan. The housing is operated by Lookout Housing and Health Society, which provides residents with daily meals, and health and wellness supports. The Village opened at a different site as a pilot project by the Cowichan Housing Association to provide immediate housing for vulnerable people during the COVID-19 pandemic. It moved to the Trunk Road property in 2022.“The Village opened in July 2020 and continues to improve as we learn and adapt,” said Michelle Staples, mayor of Duncan. “What began as a pandemic response has grown into a culturally safe wellness and recovery model. This site fills an essential gap in the continuum of housing and the city is pleased to receive continued support from the Province.”The extension is being funded through the Province’s newly established Homelessness Encampment Action Response Temporary Housing (HEARTH) program. HEARTH provides emergency housing, shelter options and immediate co-ordinated supports to help people in encampments or sheltering in public spaces to move indoors and access temporary or permanent housing options that fit their needs.Residents at The Village will eventually move to permanent supportive housing under construction in the community. The project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway, including more than 350 homes in Duncan.Quotes:Doug Routley, MLA for Nanaimo-North Cowichan –“The Village has brought vulnerable people safely indoors and connected them with services so they have supports they need to begin to rebuild their lives. Our work doesn’t stop here. I look forward to continuing to work with the Cowichan community on permanent housing solutions for people in our community.”Shayne Williams, CEO, Lookout Housing and Health Society –“Lookout Housing and Health Society is proud to operate The Village, which provides safe and healthy housing for some of our communities most vulnerable in Duncan. Lookout is honoured to partner with BC Housing and the City of Duncan on this successful housing model that demonstrates better health outcomes for those who call The Village their home.”Rob Douglas, mayor, North Cowichan –“Funding for the continued operation of The Village will not only benefit Duncan, but also North Cowichan and the broader Cowichan region. Through temporary housing and extensive supports, this model has proven successful in helping people facing homelessness to get back on their feet, improve their health and well-being, and access services.”Quick Facts:\n\tThe Province, through BC Housing, will provide approximately $1.5 million in annual operating funding for the Village through Dec. 31, 2026.\n\tThe HEARTH program is part of Belonging in BC, the Province's plan to prevent and reduce homelessness.\n\tThe plan will also add thousands of new supportive housing units and hundreds of complex-care spaces provincewide.\n\tBC Housing provided the land for the project, which will be used in the future for an affordable housing development.\n\tThe housing structures are owned by Cowichan Housing Association.\nLearn More:To learn more about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436A map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C. is available online: https://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/",

We know that the vast majority of commercial drivers in B.C. operate safely and responsibly. However, some operators are not getting the message.“In the interest of public safety, B.C.’s Commercial Vehicle Safety and Enforcement branch (CVSE) has used its new powers to suspend the safety certificate for Chohan Freight Forwarders Ltd.“This means the company’s entire fleet of 65 commercial vehicles will be unable to operate in B.C. as of 4:30 p.m. (Pacific time) on Friday, Dec. 29, 2023. Furthermore, the driver and the carrier responsible will face the toughest fines in the country. The outcome of the investigation could lead to further action.“This suspension is a result of the company’s unwillingness or inability to operate safely within the province, following its sixth infrastructure crash in two years.“We recently announced increased fines and the ability to ground fleets through suspensions like this, so highway traffic keeps moving safely and reliably for travellers and commercial vehicles, and people can count on their commute.”",

    "contents": "KELOWNA – Non-profit operators have been selected for two new temporary housing projects underway for people experiencing homelessness in Kelowna.Following a request for proposals, BC Housing has selected the John Howard Society of Okanagan and Kootenay to operate the housing project at 759 Crowley Ave. and Turning Points Collaborative Society for the housing development at 2740 Highway 97 N. “We know this housing is needed urgently, which is why we have worked quickly to secure experienced operators who can provide the necessary supports and services vulnerable people need to stabilize their lives,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “We know that work is far from done, which is why we will continue to take urgent action to expedite construction on these homes so people can move in as soon as possible.”In partnership with the City of Kelowna, these projects will provide a total of 120 supportive homes for people experiencing homelessness in the community. The Crowley Avenue project is anticipated to be complete and have residents moving in February 2024. The Highway 97 North project is anticipated to be complete by March 2024. The sites are on land owned by the City of Kelowna, which will lease the land to the Province for a nominal fee.“We appreciate the collaboration and partnership from the Province and BC Housing to advance this work quickly,” said Tom Dyas, mayor of Kelowna. “John Howard and Turning Points are both experienced and established operators, and valued partners.  With the cold season here, we look forward to seeing these sites open as soon as possible.”The societies will provide support services such as daily meals, 24/7 staffing, access to skills training and support navigating the housing system. Individuals moving into these homes will be assessed and matched with appropriate supports.The two projects are intended as temporary housing solutions, providing time for BC Housing to continue working with the City of Kelowna to identify and build new permanent supportive housing.The Province has more than 77,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway throughout the province, such as more than 1,700 homes in Kelowna.The Province and the City of Kelowna recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that formalizes their commitment to work together to better support people who are unhoused, sheltering in encampments and to help prevent future encampments. Through the MOU, the City of Kelowna commits to bring forward available land and expedite land-use decisions for new shelter and supportive-housing projects.Quick Facts:\n\tThe Province, through BC Housing, is providing a total of approximately $9.3 million for these projects from the new Homeless Encampment Action Response Temporary Housing (HEARTH) program and will provide annual operating funding.\n\tIn addition to the HEARTH program, the Province and the city are partnering to implement Homeless Encampment Action Response Teams (HEART), a new multidisciplinary regional program designed to rapidly respond to encampments to better support people sheltering outdoors to move inside.\n\tThe HEART program will bring together the provincial and local governments, Indigenous partners, health-care agencies and non-profit organizations to quickly assess the needs of people sheltering in encampments and provide rapid access to the supports and services they need to find a home.\n\tThe HEART and HEARTH programs are part of Belonging in BC, the Province's plan to prevent and reduce homelessness.\n\tThe plan will also add thousands of new supportive housing units and hundreds of complex-care housing units provincewide.\nLearn More:Read the MOU online: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/BC-MOU_Kelowna_HEART-HEARTH.pdfFor information about the HEART and HEARTH program, visit:\nhttps://www.bchousing.org/housing-assistance/homelessness-services/HEART-HEARTH",

We are proud of the work we are doing with partners like BC Housing to improve our community.”Old Massett Village Council will own and operate the two-storey building, which includes six one-bedroom and six two-bedroom units to provide much-needed off-reserve homes. The villages of Old Massett and Masset are located near to each other on the northern shore of Graham Island, the largest and northernmost island of Haida Gwaii.“We’ve purchased this building so that people can continue to live affordably, close to family, community and culture,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “Preserving and improving affordable housing in both rural and urban communities is an important part of our government’s housing plan and today’s announcement is the latest milestone in work to deliver homes for people.”Eight of the 12 units will be operated as near-market rental housing geared to middle-income households. The remaining four units will be for families with low incomes, with rents set at 30% of the household’s income.“I am proud that our government took action to secure these affordable rental homes in Massett so they can be preserved for the long term,” said Jennifer Rice, MLA for North Coast. “These homes provide a sense of well-being and a place for many to call home, and we will continue to work with Indigenous partners to build on- and off-reserve housing.”  The Province, through BC Housing, is providing $4 million to purchase and renovate the vacant building. Renovations are needed since many of the building’s components have reached the end of their service life. Residents are expected to start moving into their new homes when renovations are completed in late 2024.This project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government.

We will continue to work in partnership with organizations like the Haven Society to provide the safety, supports and services that can help rebuild people’s lives.”The four-storey, wood-frame building will provide 30 self-contained second-stage housing units with their own bathroom and kitchen, as well as 10 rooms with a total of 17 transition beds for short-term stays. Three second-stage housing units and one transition room will be wheelchair accessible.The housing will be operated by Haven Society, which supports adults and children leaving gender-based violence. This new building will replace an ageing 17-unit transition home operated by Haven Society. Once construction is finished, Haven will transfer its services and programming to the new building, which has a communal kitchen, amenity room and expanded programming spaces. The building is also close to public parks and a public recreation centre.“No one should feel unsafe in their home and their community. Yet too many women and gender-diverse people continue to face obstacles after leaving intimate-partner violence,” said Kelli Paddon, Parliamentary Secretary for Gender Equity. “These new transition and second-stage homes will offer much-needed support through programming and living arrangements to survivors and their children as they work to rebuild their lives in a safe and compassionate space.”Transition housing provides safe, temporary shelter with supports for people who need a place to go after leaving a violent or abusive situation. After a stay in a transition house, guests can move to second-stage housing for approximately six to 18 months before moving to more permanent housing in the community. Second-stage housing includes services to help women rebuild their independence, including support groups, system navigation and individualized assistance.Construction is expected to be completed in fall 2024.This project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway, including more than 1,600 homes in Nanaimo.Quotes:Sheila Malcolmson, MLA for Nanaimo, and Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction – “Women and children fleeing violence need safe housing for a new start. Partnering with Nanaimo’s beloved Haven Society, our government is providing much-needed housing to help stabilize and heal after violence, so that women and their children are able to put down roots and look forward to a more secure future.”Daylene Jones, executive director, Haven Society –“With the rental market in Nanaimo having only a 2.2% vacancy rate, finding affordable housing for women and families leaving violence is incredibly difficult. The addition of these second-stage units will help immensely in the transition from leaving abuse to finding long-term security and stability.”Leonard Krog, mayor of Nanaimo –“Council is incredibly grateful and pleased to welcome this very significant and much-needed housing. Gender-based violence is a serious issue. Haven Society will be better able to deliver their valuable services and supports with this new facility.”Quick Facts:\n\tThe Province, through BC Housing, is providing $17.5 million through the Building BC: Women’s Transition Housing Fund for the land and construction of the building.\n\tResidents of the second-stage home will pay either 30% of their income for rent or, for those receiving income or disability assistance, the provincial shelter rate.\n\tTransition homes guests will not be charged rent.\n\tAs is generally the case for projects that support women and children leaving violence, the address of this project has not been disclosed for safety reasons.\nLearn More:To learn more about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for people in British Columbia, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/",

Construction will begin in late 2024.The 264th Street Interchange area is highly travelled during morning and afternoon hours, including a high volume of commercial vehicles heading to and from the border crossing. Along with allowing more efficient goods movement, the new interchange will include improvements for active transportation, truck parking and public transit.“We are making the infrastructure improvements necessary to support future growth in the Fraser Valley,” said Dan Coulter, Minister of State for Infrastructure and Transit. “Advance work is already underway on Highway 1 east of 264th Street, which will support an upgraded 264th Street Interchange and highway widening as work progresses.”The 264th Street Interchange and associated highway widening is one of the three major construction contracts that make up Phase 3A of the Province’s Fraser Valley Highway 1 Corridor Improvement Program, a multi-phase program to improve goods movement and travel along Highway 1 in the Fraser Valley through the Sumas Prairie to Chilliwack.The other two contracts will be upgrades to the Mt. Lehman Interchange and 3.7 kilometres of highway widening, and replacement of the Bradner Road overpass with 3.9 kilometres of highway widening. These contracts will go to tender in spring 2024 ahead of the construction season. Completion of Phase 3A is expected in 2029.The widening of Highway 1 between 264th Street and Mt.

Work is expected to begin in February 2024, including:\n\tclearing, rock blasting and offloading the existing slide and roadway;\n\trealigning the road onto solid bedrock;\n\tupsizing the existing culvert;\n\tinstalling a reinforced retaining wall; and\n\tbuilding a temporary barge landing facility at Boundary Passage Drive to transport equipment and materials.\nThe damaged section of road is approximately 2.5 kilometres east of Pender Canal Bridge, the link between North Pender Island and South Pender Island. Permanent repairs will increase the road’s resilience in future extreme rain events, helping island residents safe and connected.Safety measures were implemented following the flooding damage to the road, including single-lane-alternating traffic with timed signals at each end of the site, slope deformation monitors to track earth movement and load restrictions during and after significant rain events.Crews will continue to monitor road deformation and perform necessary maintenance throughout the project.Additional federal environmental permitting has been secured due to the project’s proximity to the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve. Revegetation and mitigation measures will be in place following construction.Single-lane-alternating traffic will remain in place for the duration of the work. Drivers should expect delays, including intermittent road closures for up to four hours. All efforts will be made to minimize traffic disruptions during peak travel times.

    "contents": "CACHE CREEK – Travellers passing through Cache Creek will soon have a safer, more reliable journey, with work about to begin on the Cache Creek Crossing Restoration Project. The Highway 97 Cache Creek Crossing Restoration Project includes the installation of a bridge to replace the culvert under Highway 97 where it crosses Cache Creek. The new four-lane bridge will be designed to handle peak river flows and debris, especially during spring freshet. It will accommodate increases in peak water flows caused by climate change and will be built to ensure structural stability against erosion.In addition to improving travel for Cache Creek residents, the upgrades will improve the resilience and reliability of the vital Highway 97 corridor.A $5.4-million contract for the project was awarded to Acres Enterprises Ltd. Work is scheduled to be complete by Aug. 31, 2024.Preparation work is underway and will include the relocation of a watermain in advance of bridge construction. During the coming months, construction crews will continue work at the site, such as construction of the bridge and realigning and widening the creek.Travellers are advised to watch for construction and traffic personnel.Learn More:For real-time updates, check the DriveBC website: https://www.drivebc.caFor more information about the project, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation-projects/other-transportation-projects/cache-creek-crossing",

    "title": "New affordable homes coming for First Nations in Merritt",
    "contents": "MERRITT – First Nations families, elders and youth in Merritt will have access to more affordable rental homes, with construction underway on a 52-unit development.“People thrive when they can live in the community they know, close to their family and friends,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “Our government is proud to support the Nicola Bands to build housing in their communities. These 52 new homes will play a key role in helping many elders, youth and families build good lives, and we will continue to work with Indigenous partners to build on- and off-reserve housing.”  The new four-storey building, located at 2640 Spring Bank Ave., will help address the housing needs for First Nations community members from five Nicola Bands: Upper Nicola Band, Lower Nicola Indian Band, Coldwater Indian Band, Nooaitch Indian Band and Shackan Indian Band. It will feature a mix of studio and one-, two- and three-bedroom units. Thirty-six of the 52 units will either be accessible or adaptable to accommodate current and changing accessibility needs. Each unit will have a private balcony.The Nicola Native Lodge Society is providing the land for the project and will manage the housing. The development will accommodate intergenerational living, such as elders and youth in the same building, which is aligned with the society’s vision for culturally safe housing. The building will also feature an amenity space for social gatherings and cultural ceremonies.Construction is expected to be completed by spring 2025.This project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes delivered or underway, including approximately 170 homes in Merritt.Quotes:Arnie Lampreau, Chief, Shackan Indian Band –“This project was a dream of many of our Nlaka’pamux Elders and leaders, many of whom have passed away and never saw the dream become a reality. The thought of going outside Nicola Valley was one of the fears of our people. This is a chance for the future people to retire and have a safe place to live.”Stuart Jackson, Chief, Lower Nicola Indian Band –“It is with great pleasure that this project has come to fruition. Housing shortages are a crisis in our communities and this project will help alleviate some of these challenges. I raise my hands to all the people behind the scenes who turned this dream into a reality. Huxme’l knee.”Sharon Stone, board director, Shackan Indian Band –“We recognize housing has an impact on many First Nations people. We need a place to call home, a sense of belonging, a sense of identity to be grounded to, and walk among the living plants, trees, rocks and water. Once we feel this, we will be at peace with ourselves, family and connected to one another.”John Aldag, Member of Parliament for Cloverdale-Langley City on behalf of Sean Fraser, federal Minister of Housing, Infrastructure and Communities –“Investing in affordable housing is more important than ever. Through the partnership with the Government of British Columbia, people of all ages will have access to housing so they can remain in their community. This project announced today is just one example of what we can achieve with our partners. I look forward to the completion of these housing projects and the positive impact it will have in our community.”Michael Goetz, mayor of Merritt –“We are thrilled to welcome such a distinctive and inclusive affordable housing project like the Spring Bank multi-unit development within our community. This project will not only bring much needed housing to the community, but it will also bring us one step closer to building a more integrated and supportive community that embraces our diverse cultures and honours the spirit of reconciliation.”Quick Facts:\n\tThe Province, through BC Housing, is contributing approximately $10 million to the project through the Building BC: Indigenous Housing Fund.  \n\tA joint contribution of approximately $1.3 million, through the Canada-British Columbia Bilateral Agreement under the National Housing Strategy, also went toward the project.\n\tBudget 2023 added approximately $1.3 billion to the Indigenous Housing Fund, for a total of approximately $1.8 billion to build 3,500 units of social housing for Indigenous Peoples on and off reserve.\n\tCanada’s National Housing Strategy is a 10-year, $82-plus billion plan that will give more people in Canada a place to call home.  \nLearn More:To learn about B.C.’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for people in British Columbia, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/To find out about the National Housing Strategy, visit: https://www.placetocallhome.ca/For information about Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, visit: https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/",

    "contents": "VICTORIA – An innovative approach to data collection and reporting is helping government better understand the underlying factors that lead to homelessness and better support people in finding stable housing and services that meet their needs.The 2021 estimate of the number of people experiencing homelessness in B.C., an update from the 2020 and 2019 estimates, is part of government’s Preventing and Reducing Homelessness Integrated Data project. The project estimates the number of people who experienced homelessness in the province.As the data grows, it allows government to make evidence-based decisions on what services and supports are needed most to prevent or end the cycle for people experiencing homelessness in B.C.The report adds another year of data to the 2020 and 2019 estimates that were released last year. This project links de-identified data from the Ministry of Social Development and Poverty Reduction, the Ministry of Health and BC Housing to estimate the number of people who have experienced homelessness in B.C.With an updated data set for 2021, analysts can begin to see the emergence of some patterns. The numbers offer the ability to monitor seasonal and geographic trends, and demographics of individuals in B.C. who experience homelessness.According to the research, the latest findings show:\n\t11,896 people, on average, were identified as experiencing homelessness each month, (range = 11,331 in February to 12,758 in December).\n\t26,240 people experienced homelessness in B.C. at some point in 2021. In comparison, 24,270 people experienced homelessness at some point in 2020, and 24,507 people experienced homelessness at some point in 2019.\n\t10,424 people were newly identified in 2021 as not having experienced homelessness in 2020 or 2019, while 10,013 people who had experienced homelesness in 2020 did not meet the definition of experiencing it again in 2021.\nThe data counts people who accessed income assistance and people who reported having no fixed address and people who accessed a shelter over the course of 2021. The data also shows where people are experiencing homelessness, whether their homelessness was short term or chronic, and examines when people enter and exit homelessness.Government is using this data to implement Belonging in BC, the Province’s plan to prevent and reduce homelessness. The plan adds thousands of new supportive housing units and hundreds of complex-care spaces provincewide, and creates multidisciplinary regional response teams designed to rapidly respond to encampments to better support people sheltering outdoors to move inside.Quick Facts:\n\tThe Belonging in BC homelessness plan is delivered through initiatives across government and supported by investments of $1.18 billion in Budget 2023 and $633 million in Budget 2022.\n\tSince 2017, government has helped approximately 5,600 people who were experiencing, or at risk of, homelessness move into new supportive housing.\n\tAnother 2,300 supportive homes are underway, including approximately 860 homes coming to Vancouver and 250 in Victoria.\n\tIn addition, the Province is funding more than 5,500 shelter spaces in 55 communities throughout the province this winter, including permanent, temporary and extreme-weather response shelters.\nLearn More: To view the full report and find out more about what the Province is doing to help prevent homelessness, visit:\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/affordable-and-social-housing/homelessness/homelessness-cohort",

    "title": "Tougher action to deter trucks from hitting overpasses will make travel safer",
    "contents": "DELTA – Tougher action is being taken to prevent truckers from crashing into highway infrastructure throughout B.C. as stronger deterrents against unsafe commercial-vehicle drivers will make highway travel safer.Trucking companies involved in infrastructure crashes will see stronger consequences that escalate for repeat offences. In cases where a company has a history of non-compliance, including previous infrastructure crashes, enforcement measures will become increasingly severe. This includes potential suspension and possible cancellation of a company's carrier safety certificate, essentially preventing their operation in B.C.Unprecedented penalties have recently been imposed by suspending a company’s entire fleet, while Commercial Vehicle Safety and Enforcement investigates a crash.  The immediate suspensions and the significant cost they bring to a company will be a permanent tool. However, repeat offenders will face longer suspensions and may have their certificate to operate in B.C. revoked. “Infrastructure crashes have a huge impact. They delay commuters, affect the movement of goods and can impede first responders. This means families, businesses and the economy all suffer,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “Safety is the priority and this issue needs to stop. That’s why we’re taking tougher action, grounding fleets through suspensions and increasing fines, so highway traffic keeps moving safely and reliably for travellers and commercial vehicles, and people can count on their commute.” Recent regulatory changes will also bring in new and higher fines for various offences, holding carriers and drivers accountable for the safe and professional movement of goods on provincial highways. Additionally, new speed-limiter regulations will further improve safety by requiring heavy commercial vehicles operating in the province to have their speed-limiting systems activated and programmed by April 5, 2024. This will prevent these vehicles from travelling more than 105 km/h on B.C. highways. The fine for speed-limiter non-compliance and tampering is $295 and three driver penalty points.“The BC Trucking Association welcomes and supports the decisive measures taken by the provincial government to enhance safety and reduce infrastructure crashes involving commercial heavy-duty trucks,” said Dave Earle, president and CEO, BC Trucking Association. “These initiatives mark a pivotal step toward creating safer roadways for all and underscore our shared commitment to fostering a culture focused on risk-prevention in the trucking industry.”Specific amendments to the Commercial Transport Regulations and the Motor Vehicle Act Regulations bring in new offences and higher fines to address over-height vehicles and loads, as well as require dump-style vehicles to have in-cab warning devices by June 1, 2024. This will alert a driver if the dump box is raised when the vehicle is in motion. The over-height vehicle related fines will be $575 (previously $115), making this the highest fine of its nature in Canada. Not complying with having in-cab warning devices in dump trucks will result in a fine of $598.While B.C.’s new fines for infrastructure crashes will become the highest in Canada, fine amounts are currently limited by legislation. The Province is reviewing potential legislative changes that would allow even higher fines in the future. Learn More:To learn about the new progressive-enforcement framework, visit: https://www.cvse.ca/whatsnew.htmlFor more information about B.C. legislation, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/legislation",

    "title": "New affordable rental homes open for Indigenous people in SookeFacts about the Indigenous housing project in Sooke",
    "contents": "SOOKE – Indigenous families, elders and people in Sooke now have access to 75 below-market homes, with the opening of a new purpose-built rental building at 2170 Charters Rd.“With this opening, we’re providing peace of mind and hope for families and people who need a little extra help to make ends meet,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “These new homes will not only provide safe places for them to live in, but also enable them to participate fully in the community without having to worry about very high rents.”The new four-storey apartment building has a mix of studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom homes. Thirteen units are rented at the provincial shelter rate for people with very low incomes. The building is also pet-friendly, allowing cats and small dogs.This project is the result of a partnership between the Province, through BC Housing, the federal government, through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the Capital Regional District, and M’akola Housing Society.“Through the National Housing Strategy, we are investing in affordable housing across the country, including right here in Sooke,” said Sean Fraser, federal Minister of Housing, Infrastructure and Communities. “I am proud that we supported these 75 new homes, which mark a new chapter for those who will live in them. Everyone deserves a safe place to call home and we are committed to making that a reality for all Canadians.”M’akola Housing Society will operate the building and will prioritize Indigenous individuals, seniors and families for the homes. Non-Indigenous residents are also welcome. People started moving into their new homes in October 2023.“These affordable homes are a tremendous help to people who are already struggling to get by,” said Ravi Parmar, MLA for Langford-Juan de Fuca. “Affordable Indigenous housing is needed all over the province. We are grateful to partners involved for bringing these homes to Sooke, so people can stay in the community they call home.”This project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes delivered or underway, including 278 homes in Sooke.Quotes: Jonathan Wilkinson, federal Minister of Energy and Natural Resources –“The Government of Canada is pleased to have supported this important development in Sooke. We are committed to making communities stronger through projects such as these here in British Columbia and across Canada. Not only do these investments help create new jobs and stimulate the local economy, they also help to provide access to secure and affordable homes for community members. This collaborative effort is helping to ensure that more individuals have a place they can call home.”Margaret Pfoh, CEO, Aboriginal Housing Management Association (AHMA) –“AHMA celebrates our member, M’akola, for its tireless efforts to collaboratively provide safe, affordable, culturally supported Indigenous housing. Housing is a central social determinant of health and well-being so there is no better investment that can be made in social equity. Indigenous people are 13 times more likely than non-Indigenous people to experience homelessness and that is not acceptable.”Kevin Albers, CEO, M'akola Housing Society –“The availability of Indigenous affordable housing is crucial for the well-being of families and communities. It provides a sense of security and stability, which is essential for people and communities to thrive. The Charters Road project is a testament to the power of the partnerships and collaboration between BC Housing, the Capital Regional District, the District of Sooke, M’akola Housing Society and M’akola Development Services.”Maja Tait, mayor, Sooke –“Today, we’re recognizing a major milestone in bringing much-needed below-market housing to our community. I want to thank the provincial government and M’akola Housing Society for their funding and support – responding to the needs of Sooke. Along with the housing project, the supporting infrastructure contributions being made through this project are helping us add a critical pedestrian corridor, impacting not only the residents living at 2170 Charters Road, but so many more in our community.”Colin Plant, chair, Capital Regional District board –“The Charters development was, in part, made possible through a grant from the Regional Housing Trust Fund (RHTF) to go toward the development of affordable housing units in the region. It’s also a demonstration of the successful application of the RHTF partnership between local, provincial and federal governments, the kind of collaboration we need in order to build more buildings like Charters to address our ongoing housing crisis.”Learn More:To learn about B.C.’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/For the most requested Government of Canada housing information, visit: https://www.canada.ca/en/services/finance/manage/housing.htmlTo find out about the National Housing Strategy, visit: http://www.placetocallhome.ca/For information about Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, visit: https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/A backgrounder follows.\n\tThe Province, through BC Housing, provided approximately $5.6 million for the project, including:\n\t\t$4.5 million through the Provincial Investment in Affordable Housing fund; and\n\t\tMore than $1.1 million from the Investment in Housing Innovation fund.\n\t\n\tM’akola Housing Society provided more than $5 million in equity.\n\tThe federal government provided $3.75 million through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation’s National Housing Co-Investment Fund.\n\tA $838,668 contribution of joint funding through the Canada-British Columbia Bilateral Agreement under the National Housing Strategy also went toward the project.\n\tThe Capital Regional District provided $330,000 through the Regional Housing Trust Fund.",

    "title": "B.C. improving services, wait times for tenants, landlordsActions taken to better protect rentersFacts about improved Residential Tenancy Branch services",
    "contents": "VICTORIA – Renters and landlords in B.C. are seeing faster and more efficient residential tenancy dispute resolutions thanks to government’s recent service improvements.“Nothing is more frustrating for renters and landlords than when the relationship breaks down. It is vitally important that they get clear resolutions faster,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “That’s why we have made significant investments to improve wait times. We have made great strides over this past year to address these issues with exceptional results. The actions we are taking will only continue to speed up service and increase user clarity as we work towards ensuring that renters and landlords can easily access the services they need.”Dispute resolution services at the Province’s Residential Tenancy Branch (RTB) have substantially improved in several ways over the last year, including:\n\ta 48% reduction in all tenancy dispute hearing wait times, including down to nine weeks for a standard hearing from about 16 weeks a year ago;\n\tdispute resolution application processing times take, on average, about 1.4 days compared to nearly 10 days in November 2022;\n\tthe average wait time for service by phone is now less than seven minutes compared to more than 17 minutes last November; and\n\tresponse times to general emails now take an average of one business day.\nThese improvements have occurred despite increases in both dispute applications and inquiries. The RTB saw a 10% increase in applications in 2023, averaging 2,005 applications per month, compared to an average of 1,811 per month in 2022.“Going through a residential tenancy dispute process should be as easy, fast and hassle-free as possible, especially as this is already a stressful situation for tenants who simply want their homes to be safe, secure and stable,” said Spencer Chandra Herbert, premier’s liaison for renters. “These improvements to processes and faster service are a great step in the right direction as we work to better support B.C. tenants in ensuring they have the dependable homes they need and deserve.” The improved services are the result of approximately $15.6 million in additional funding, a 40% budget increase, the Province committed to the RTB in December 2022 to speed up and strengthen residential tenancy dispute resolution. The budget increase allowed the RTB to create nearly 50 full-time staff positions, including a doubling of the size of the Compliance and Enforcement Unit. The expanded capacity has allowed the unit to intervene more quickly to resolve issues that affect the livelihood of tenants and landlords in cases where serious and repeated violations of the Residential Tenancy Act occur.“Timely access to justice at the Residential Tenancy Branch is critical for both landlords and tenants,” said David Hutniak, CEO, LandlordBC. “While there’s more work to be done, members have been telling us that they are seeing promising improvements to wait times. LandlordBC looks forward to continuing to collaborate with the branch to build upon these early encouraging results.”Alongside improvements to wait times, the RTB has also launched updated web content as part of the Province’s continued commitment to make the branch’s services and information more accessible to tenants and landlords. The new website, which launched Dec. 7, was designed by asking users what was and was not working. With this feedback, the Province created user-focused and easier-to-navigate web content that supports efficient access to information and dispute-resolution services for tenants and landlords.This updated web content adds to the RTB’s expanding toolkit of accessibility services, such as the recent launch of real-time interpretation for branch services in more than 200 languages. From April to October 2023, interpreter services were accessed in 134 calls and 97 hearings, spanning from American Sign Language to 14 other languages, including Arabic, French, Farsi, Hindi and Cantonese. The demand for these immediate and scheduled interpreter services has risen consistently since the launch of the service in April.The RTB will continue to revitalize its tenancy dispute and investigation processes by improving service accessibility and increasing procedural efficiency. The work is part of the Province’s $19-billion housing investment. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway.\nLearn More:To see the updated Residential Tenancy Branch web content, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/residential-tenanciesTo learn more about the Residential Tenancy Branch offering service in more than 200 languages, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0060-000874To learn more about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housingTwo backgrounders follow.\n\tThe RTB’s improved and faster services build on multiple actions the Province has taken to better protect renters since 2017, including:\n\t\tcapping rent increases below inflation at 3.5% in 2024;\n\t\tbanning illegal “renovictions”, which are evictions carried out to renovate or repair a rental unit;\n\t\tlaunching Canada’s first provincewide rent bank;\n\t\tclosing the fixed-term lease loophole;\n\t\tending all strata rental-restriction bylaws; and\n\t\tlimiting age-restriction bylaws in strata housing, except for people 55 and older.\n\t\nEach year, the Residential Tenancy Branch (RTB) receives approximately 200,000 calls requesting information or assistance and more than 20,000 applications for dispute resolution.To ensure that the Province, through the RTB, is meeting the needs and desired outcomes of a high volume of tenants and landlords, further improvements have been undertaken in addition to new web content and increased staffing. This includes procedural improvements to increase efficiency while maintaining procedural fairness, a reduced need for hearings through the compliance and enforcement unit in addition to recent legislative amendments.Additional procedural enhancements\n\tProcedural enhancements to increase efficiency include the following:\n\t\tthe implementation of a dispute stream that fast-tracks time-sensitive applications, such as unpaid rent or utilities, providing landlords with faster access to services when they have not received payment;\n\t\tan expansion of the types of disputes eligible for direct request to include tenancies ending with cause allowing for faster resolutions. Direct requests are used for straightforward applications where the other party does not dispute the application and, as a result, a full hearing is not required. This frees up hearing slots for other cases. Direct request wait times dropped by nearly 84% in November 2023 compared to November 2022;\n\t\tan expansion of the grounds for review to allow the RTB to undertake a review where it is clear an error has been made without having to send it to judicial review reducing costs to tenants and landlords, the courts and government; and\n\t\tenhanced screening for all dispute applications to improve efficiency and reduce delays for tenants and landlords by ensuring all information is accurate and complete and that all prior required steps were taken before an application is set for a hearing.\n\t\nCompliance and Enforcement Unit (CEU) improvements\n\tIn 2023, 386 complaints were received by the CEU.\n\tWith its expanded capacity, the CEU initiated 51 investigations and issued 14 monetary penalties totalling $56,200. Many of these complaints were resolved by voluntary compliance without the need for an investigation.\n\tWith these interventions, the need for hearings were often avoided allowing the RTB to better direct their resources.\nAmendments to Residential Tenancy Act/Manufactured Home Park Tenancy Act\n\tThe Residential Tenancy Act/Manufactured Home Park Tenancy Act amendments in Bill 42 received Royal Assent in November 2023.\n\tThe amendments provide several procedural improvements that increase efficiency and timeliness in all phases of the RTB’s dispute-resolution process by allowing more flexibility around procedural requirements, including new initiatives such the ability to provide decisions orally rather than in written format.\nApplication of enhanced residential tenancy services to the Squamish First Nation\n\tAs a result of a recent agreement with Squamish First Nation (SFN), the Residential Tenancy Act now applies on SFN lands. This is an important step toward reconciliation.\n\tWith this change, tenants and landlords residing on SFN lands will also have access to RTB protections with greater ease and efficiency in instances where a Squamish-led facilitation process has not been successful in resolving the dispute.\n\tRTB staff are all undertaking cultural competency training and the branch is working closely with SFN to implement this change.",

    "contents": "LYTTON – People travelling Highway 1 south of Spences Bridge will have faster travel times with the opening of two-way traffic two years after the road was severely damaged in the 2021 floods. Traffic will open to a single lane in each direction starting Friday, Dec. 15, 2023, on the Falls Creek Bridge (Jackass Mountain), located 55 kilometres south of Spences Bridge.  A temporary single-lane bridge has been in place since a culvert washout in 2021. A new three-lane permanent Falls Creek bridge is under construction and will be completed next year.“Getting to this phase of the Falls Creek project marks a significant achievement in our recovery from the 2021 atmospheric river and our efforts to enhance the safety and reliability of Highway 1,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “Over the last two years, I have seen the remarkable dedication of our ministry staff, contractors, and Indigenous and municipal leaders who have come together to support the recovery from the unprecedented floods. Our government is committed to rebuilding safe and efficient infrastructure that can withstand future climate events.”Jordan Spinks, Chief of Kanaka Bar Indian Band, said: “Kanaka Bar Band and its members are excited to hear that Highway 1 will be opening back to two lanes. It has been a long two years for our community since the atmospheric river event and how the aftermath impacted our daily commute. We have had a great relationship with the Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure and the Falls Creek Alliance team, and are grateful for the collaboration and information sharing during the highway repairs. We look forward to some normalcy in our daily commute and a continued working relationship with all involved with the Falls Creek Highway Project.”The new bridge will enhance traffic flow and is designed for resilience against severe weather conditions.Drivers can expect reduced speed limits until construction is complete.Quick Facts: \n\tFalls Creek culvert on Jackass Mountain was washed out during the floods in November 2021.\n\tHighway 1 through the Fraser-Thompson Corridor closed between Spences Bridge and Hope on Nov. 14, 2021, due to damage caused by heavy rains.\n\tMore than 150 workers, using 80 pieces of equipment, moved more than 150,000 cubic metres of gravel, rock and other material to repair and reopen Highway 1 to vehicle traffic on Jan. 14, 2022 (Lytton to Spences Bridge), and Jan. 24, 2022 (Lytton to Boston Bar).\n\tThere were 18 sites affected on Highway 1 between Hope and Spences Bridge, including four that required extensive temporary repairs to reopen.\nLearn More: For up-to-date information about driving conditions, visit: https://drivebc.ca/To know more about Falls Creek project, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation-projects/bc-highway-flood-recovery/2021-flood-road-recovery-projects-highway-1-fraser-canyon/falls-creek-jackass-mountain",

    "contents": "COQUITLAM – kʷikʷəƛ̓əm (Kwikwetlem) First Nation families, individuals and elders will soon move into 14 new homes with the opening of an affordable rental development on reserve at Lot 16, 65 Colony Farm Rd.“Lot 16 will provide much-needed safe, quality and accessible affordable housing to meet the needs of our growing population, which has increased by 6.8% each year from 2011 to 2023,” said Chief Ron Giesbrecht, kʷikʷəƛ̓əm First Nation. “With this new multi-unit housing project we are able to welcome back home more of our members and elders who have been living in the United States, as well as other parts of the Lower Mainland to rejoin their community and return to their ancestral village of slakəyánc.”The new development has 14 homes spread across two three-storey buildings and a one-storey building. There is a mix of one-bedroom, one-bedroom-plus-den, three- and four-bedroom homes to support families of different sizes. The homes are built on the kʷikʷəƛ̓əm First Nation’s ancient village site, now called slakəyánc, which means “young sockeye” in the Nation’s hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓ language. Approximately 36% of the Nation’s members make their home at slakəyánc.“With this opening, more people from the kʷikʷəƛ̓əm First Nation can live in their home community connected to family and culture,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “As the first province in the country to invest in on-Nation housing, our government is proud to be partnering with the Nation to build these new affordable homes for their members. I look forward to seeing the impact this development will have on the community for years to come.”The project is the result of a partnership between the kʷikʷəƛ̓əm First Nation, the Province through BC Housing, and the Government of Canada through Indigenous Services Canada.“Communities are stronger when people can grow up there, raise a family and age in place,” said Fin Donnelly, MLA for Coquitlam-Burke Mountain. “Thank you to the kʷikʷəƛ̓əm Nation for their leadership in building these homes. These types of partnerships are one way our government is addressing the housing crisis. We will continue to partner with First Nations to create housing, on  and off reserve, throughout B.C.”These homes are the first project to be completed by the kʷikʷəƛ̓əm First Nation (KFN) under its historic Land Code passed in 2020, which transferred the management of reserve lands from the Government of Canada back to the Nation. The federal government had managed these lands since 1876.“My congratulations to the kʷikʷəƛ̓əm First Nation for their leadership and work to deliver these safe, secure and urgently needed homes for their members,” said Selina Robinson, MLA for Coquitlam-Maillardville. “This development benefits the whole community, with more homes for people who are looking for an affordable place to live without having to leave the surrounding area.”The housing will be operated by the KFN Housing Society, a non-profit housing provider owned by the Nation. Monthly rents range from $500 for a one-bedroom home to $1,200 for a four-bedroom home. Tenants are expected to move into their new homes in January 2024.This project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes delivered or underway, including approximately 460 homes in Coquitlam.Quick Facts:\n\tThe Province, through BC Housing, contributed approximately $3 million to the project through the Building BC: Indigenous Housing Fund and is providing approximately $60,000 in annual operating funding.\n\tThe kʷikʷəƛ̓əm First Nation provided the land for the project, valued at approximately $1.7 million.\n\tThe federal government, through Indigenous Services Canada, contributed $825,000 from its Housing Support Program.\n\tThe Province recently announced a second request for proposals (RFP) for the Indigenous Housing Fund (IHF).\n\tThe IHF provides approximately $1.8 billion to build 3,500 new homes for Indigenous families, individuals and elders, on- and off-reserve.\nLearn More:For information about the recently announced Indigenous Housing Fund RFP and how to apply, visit: https://news.bchousing.org/more-than-1000-new-affordable-homes-coming-for-indigenous-peopleTo learn about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for people in British Columbia, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing",

    "contents": "SICAMOUS – Replacement of the R.W. Bruhn Bridge has moved to the next phase as the Province invites potential builders to pre-qualify to participate in the bridge-replacement project to improve safety and efficiency on Highway 1 in the Shuswap region.The project will improve 2.5 kilometres of Highway 1, including four-laning of 1.9 kilometres of highway, replacing the aging R.W. Bruhn Bridge with a four-lane structure and upgrading intersections between Old Sicamous Road and Silver Sands Road.The Province is working in partnership with Splatsin First Nation to develop the project design, noting the significance of the project area to the Nation and the need to minimize environmental impacts.When the project is complete, the intersection at Old Spallumcheen Road will be closed on Highway 1. Local traffic will be rerouted under the bridge with right-in/right-out access to Highway 1 at Old Sicamous Road.The project includes a multi-use path to increase safety for pedestrians and cyclists travelling across the Sicamous narrows.Prequalified contractors will be announced in February 2024, followed by an invitation for them to bid on the construction tender.The total project cost is estimated at $224 million. This includes as much as $91 million from the Government of Canada under the Provincial-Territorial Infrastructure Component of the New Building Canada Fund. The replacement of the Bruhn bridge is a key component of the Highway 1 Four-Laning Project. For further information about the pre-qualification process, visit: https://bcbid.gov.bc.ca/page.aspx/en/bpm/process_manage_extranet/186394",

    "contents": "SALMON ARM – People experiencing homelessness in Salmon Arm have access to a safe and secure place to stay, with the opening of a new long-term shelter on 341 Fraser Ave.“These new permanent spaces will benefit the entire Salmon Arm community, as they ensure vulnerable people have a safe, warm place to stay not just during winter months but year-round,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “I would like to thank the City of Salmon Arm for working with us so diligently to get these spaces up and running. They are an important step towards ensuring everyone in the community has permanent, secure housing.”The shelter is open year-round, 24 hours a day and provides 25 beds for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness in the community, as well as daily meals and support services. The Canadian Mental Health Association Shuswap Revelstoke (CMHA-SR) is operating the shelter.The Province, through BC Housing, and the City of Salmon Arm worked together to open the modular shelter on a city-owned lot. BC Housing and the city negotiated a lease on the site for 10 years, with an option to extend for another five years. BC Housing will provide approximately $1.5 million in annual operating funding for the shelter.“Access to safe, low-barrier shelter for the unhoused is a vital component of a healthy community,” said Alan Harrison, mayor of Salmon Arm. “Providing a warm, safe place to stay is the first step in helping people move forward. The City of Salmon Arm is grateful for the work of BC Housing and CMHA for helping to make that a reality.”The shelter repurposes pre-existing modular units, allowing it to be built quickly and at a lower cost.“We are pleased to open the Marshlands shelter, and that unhoused individuals in our community will have access to year-round 24/7 shelter services,” said Dawn Dunlop, executive director of CMHA-SR. “Marshlands will connect individuals to resources and supports, that will foster individuals moving into permanent stable housing.”As part of government’s new Homes for People action plan, the Province is implementing a new homelessness framework, Belonging in BC, to prevent and reduce homelessness. While shelters provide immediate relief to people experiencing homelessness and benefit the community by bringing residents indoors, they are only one part of the housing system. Moving people into permanent, stable housing benefits everyone. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes delivered or underway, including more than 170 homes in Salmon Arm.Learn More:To learn about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for people in British Columbia, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/",

    "title": "B.C. expanding use of mass timber in buildingsFacts about mass timber",
    "contents": "BURNABY – Proposed changes to the building code will expand the use of mass timber to build taller buildings and to make stronger communities.These changes will allow buildings, such as schools, shopping centres and housing to be built faster, leading to a better environment and economy.“These proposed mass timber building code changes align with our recent work to deliver more homes near transit hubs by allowing taller buildings and more sustainable housing options near transit,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “These changes will also help reduce carbon pollution, support the forestry sector, create jobs, build more homes and lead to more vibrant, healthier communities.”The proposed code changes to the British Columbia Building and Fire Codes (BC Codes 2024) would enable taller mass timber buildings, as many as 18 storeys for residential and office buildings, instead of the current 12-storey limit. The changes would also allow for more exposed mass timber or fewer layers of encapsulation in buildings, depending on a building’s height, and allow more building types, such as schools, shopping centres and industrial facilities, to be built using mass timber.“Mass timber is a strong, clean building technology, and with these changes we can create astonishing buildings that display our world-class mass timber sector,” said Brenda Bailey, Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Innovation. “Through our Mass Timber Action Plan, we are investing in mass timber training and finding new avenues to grow our economy while reducing our environmental impact.”The proposed changes are posted for public comment on the Canadian Board for Harmonized Construction Codes website. After the comment period, the B.C. government will decide on what changes are ready to move forward and what changes, if any, need further technical analysis. Key changes are expected to be adopted as soon as spring 2024.B.C. and Quebec spearheaded a joint task group to develop the proposed code changes on an accelerated timeline to expand mass timber in Canada. Once the public comment period is complete, a package of proposed code changes will be made available to provinces and territories to consider for adoption in their codes, and for future consideration for the national building codes. These proposed changes have also been reviewed by an expert technical advisory group made up of fire safety experts, regulators, engineering and building code experts from across Canada.Increasing the opportunities for mass timber construction comes at the same time the Province is addressing the housing crisis through its Homes for People action plan. New laws introduced this fall will increase density in urban areas through small-scale multi-unit housing and transit-oriented development, creating more mass timber opportunities to build homes more quickly with a lower carbon footprint.This project builds on the government’s work to streamline and expedite provincial housing permits and authorizations, while stimulating economic growth. It is also part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes delivered or underway.\nQuotes:Linda Buchanan, mayor, City of North Vancouver –“We all want innovative, efficient and cost-effective ways to address our overlapping housing and climate crises. The City of North Vancouver has long been a leader in leveraging mass timber technology to tackle these challenges. We welcome these proposed changes to the BC Building Code, as they will allow communities to deliver more homes faster, unlock a new era of design possibilities and reduce carbon emissions.”Guido Wimmers, dean, British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) school of construction and the environment –“BCIT is delivering relevant, hands-on training to help learners master in-demand skills for the mass timber sector. This announcement supports the sector to fill current knowledge gaps in industry and combat skilled-worker challenges, while also supporting clean growth and renewable resources for the economy.”Learn More:To review or provide feedback on the proposed changes, visit the Canadian Board for Harmonized Construction Codes website:\nhttps://cbhcc-cchcc.ca/en/advancing-emtc-provisions/ For more information on B.C.’s Mass Timber Action Plan, visit: \nhttps://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2022JERI0015-000519For more information about the adoption of the new building code, visit:\nhttps://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0167-001923For more information about B.C. legislation, visit:\nhttps://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/legislationA backgrounder follows. Mass timber products are solid, structural load-bearing components, such as columns, beams and panels, used to build residential and industrial buildings.\n\tMost mass timber used in buildings is encapsulated, but proposed code changes would safely allow for more exposed mass timber or fewer layers of encapsulation in some buildings, adding for more architectural options through visually exposed wood.\n\tMass timber can match or exceed the structural performance of concrete and steel, while reducing carbon emissions by as much as 45%.\n\tBy 2035, B.C.’s mass timber sector is projected to be worth $403 million, supporting over 4,000 direct and indirect jobs in manufacturing, technology, forestry, design and engineering, and bring new jobs to communities throughout the province.\n\tThe mass timber sector will also promote new technologies and approaches to further support existing jobs.",

    "contents": "VICTORIA – Contractors who build and maintain British Columbia’s vital roads and transportation infrastructure have been honoured for their work helping to keep people and goods on the move.The B.C. Transportation Contractor of the Year awards celebrate achievements in construction, road and bridge maintenance, safety and community service.“These companies have gone above and beyond to provide excellent service to British Columbians, often during some challenging circumstances like extreme weather and wildfires,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “They have shown extraordinary commitment to innovation, diversity, community service and the environment.”Bridges and Structures award:Gitga’at Park Derochie Industrial Services Inc. is being recognized with the Bridges and Structures award for their rehabilitation of the Old Skeena Bridge near Terrace – bridging the past, present and future. The company’s work preserved the 1925 bridge’s historical significance, a symbol of the region’s rich heritage and scenic beauty. Facing a significant increase in the project's scope, the firm added a second shift and finished the work four months before schedule. Gitga’at Park Derochie also protected the surrounding natural habitat to ensure that the bridge remained a vital link in an environmentally sensitive fish-bearing river used by First Nations people for traditional activities.Paving award:Dawson Construction Limited is receiving the Paving award for resurfacing more than 54 kilometres of Highway 97 at Hixon, south of Prince George. The company’s use of 15% recycled-asphalt pavement created a smoother and sustainable road. The company switched gears and helped manage traffic during the fire season. The community appreciated Dawson’s frequent communication with the Township of Hixon. The company completed the project well ahead of schedule and within budget.Grading award:Thompson Brothers Construction is receiving the Grading award for rising to challenging circumstances in completing the Highway 29 Lynx Creek bridge replacement and highway-realignment project. As a response to flooding from a reservoir, the project included a large highway-embankment fill, a 150-metre bridge and a 280-metre causeway crossing Lynx Creek. The company moved more than two million cubic metres of material. Thompson Brothers extended a stability berm, provided embankment-wave protection and adapted final grading while adjusting schedules to accommodate new work and delays due to wildfire evacuations. While work was underway, the company maintained community access to a boat launch. Workplace Health and Safety award:AIM Roads is receiving the Workplace Health and Safety award for using a system to enhance worker safety during road maintenance, with far-reaching significance that could lead to fewer accidents or injuries across the road-construction industry. The Safety Intelligent Protection Technology (SIPT) system protects road-maintenance crews by creating a virtual fence and AI-driven hazard alarms, in addition to traffic-control devices. SIPT’s alerts mean that workers now react more swiftly to potential hazards. AIM has had fewer incidents and worker injuries since it began using SIPT.  Road and Bridge Maintenance award:Capilano Highway Services is receiving the Road and Bridge Maintenance award for redefining industry standards to keep people and goods on the move on the Sunshine Coast, with innovations like safety and quality software programs, smartphone apps and improvements to winter maintenance. The company excels in emergency operations, stepping up for temporary storm repairs to ensure safety for road users. The company supports a range of community activities and is committed to diversity and inclusivity, including hiring First Nations subcontractors. Community Service award:Yellowhead Road & Bridge Ltd. (Vanderhoof) is receiving the Community Service award. For five years, the company has partnered with the non-profit Murray Ridge Ski Area, providing crucial road maintenance, snow removal and parking-lot care to ensure safe travel for students on ski days. This partnership saves the ski club thousands of dollars each season and makes skiing more affordable for people in the community. The company also partnered with the Stellat’en First Nation on the Stella Road pedestrian walkway project, donating materials, equipment and more than 550 person hours. This one-kilometre route separates pedestrians from traffic and enjoys widespread community use, including families with children, elders, and people who use wheelchairs. Learn More:For pictures, videos and more information about the finalists and winners, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=1D2156A81E88455591A34B7AB9024A56",

    "contents": "SURREY – The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure is taking steps to keep people and goods moving safely and efficiently when winter weather hits the Lower Mainland.On Lower Mainland highways, the Province’s road and bridge maintenance contractors are prepped and ready. Weather conditions are closely monitored and anti-icing brine is proactively applied when freezing temperatures are forecast. The ministry has also worked with its contractors to improve how plows and tow trucks are deployed during snowy conditions.With any winter-weather event, bridge conditions can be unpredictable and can change quickly. Conditions on bridge structures, especially over water, behave differently than a regular highway. The Port Mann and Alex Fraser bridges are equipped with a cable-collar system to remove ice and snow from the cables. Advanced weather data means crews are better prepared and can activate the systems sooner to remove snow in bad weather as quickly as possible.In certain conditions, a partial or full closure of the bridges and roads may be necessary to ensure driver safety. The ministry will update people as quickly as possible about any closure through DriveBC and its social media channels, and other methods such as signage and traffic advisories to local media.As each weather event can be unique, the ministry and its maintenance contractors will also continue to work closely with local governments on assessing, preparing and communicating for each event as it occurs.During snowy weather, drivers are encouraged to plan and check DriveBC, stay off the road if conditions worsen, and to ensure their vehicle is properly equipped with snow tires if they have to travel.Drivers can also assist maintenance crews by moving over safely when they see a vehicle with an amber light approaching. This allows maintenance crews to clear the snow and improve road conditions, to reduce hazards for drivers and help them get to where they’re going safely.Learn More:For resources on how to stay safe on the road in winter, visit: https://roadsafetyatwork.ca/campaign/shift-into-winter/To check road conditions, visit: https://www.drivebc.ca/",
