    "description": "The application is for rezoning at 8120 and 8140 No. 1 Road from the “Single Detached (RS1/E)” Zone to the “Low Density Townhouses (RTL4)” Zone. The proposal is to develop nine townhouse units with vehicle access from No. 1 Road. The existing dwellings on the subject site are proposed to be demolished. The surrounding development consists of single-family dwellings and townhouses. The Official Community Plan (OCP) land use designation for the subject properties is “Neighbourhood Residential”, and the Arterial Road Land Use Policy designation is “Arterial Road Townhouse”, subject to specific development criteria. The redevelopment proposal is consistent with these designations. The redevelopment proposal involves land assembly with a frontage less than 50 m on No. 1 Road, but staff support the application due to efforts made to acquire adjacent properties, financial feasibility, and submission of a preliminary concept plan for future redevelopment with shared vehicle access.",
