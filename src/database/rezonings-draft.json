The building height is stepped down to two-storeys along the east property line to provide an appropriate transition to the adjacent single-family home. Along the west property line, an entry driveway is being proposed and the three-storey building will be set back 9.42 m from the west property line.

The proposal also involves landscaped restoration within the existing Riparian Management Area (RMA) along the south side of the existing site, as well as improvements to pedestrian circulation and landscaping within the surface parking area on Lot 2. The site is zoned 'Industrial Business Park (ZI3) - Crestwood Area (East Cambie)'. The Applicant has proposed Transportation Demand Management (TDM) measures to support the requested variance in parking requirements, including an employee shuttle service between the subject site and the Bridgeport Canada Line station during peak hours, and a subsidized monthly transit pass program to Lot 1 employees, which will run for three years.",
