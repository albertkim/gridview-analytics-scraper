The proposed modification to the Tree Management Plan and Landscape Plan is to address the deterioration and irreversible decline of a tree (Tree Tag #726) that was supposed to be retained. The applicant agreed to plant 62 new trees on-site, including 13 conifers and 49 deciduous trees. Tree 726 has shown signs of decline since June 2022 and is in an advanced state of irreversible decline, according to the Project Arborist's findings. The City's Tree Preservation staff have reviewed and agreed with these findings.",

The site is currently zoned as 'Industrial (I)' and is used for truck and industrial equipment storage. The proposed barge ramp would be located within the ESA portion of the site. The owner plans to construct a barge ramp in the water lot in front of the site for transporting aggregate materials. No aggregate materials would be stored on-site. The water lot is currently leased and used for log storage. The owner has entered into a memorandum of understanding with the leaseholder and has submitted a crown land lease application to the Province for the change in water lot use. Access to the ramp would be provided via a truck staging area and a drive aisle on the site. The development would not include any additional buildings or structures beyond the barge ramp. The existing office operation in the shipping containers would remain. The site would be raised to prepare for future dike improvements and climate change effects, with lock block walls installed along the property lines. Truck traffic would access the barges via the raised surface. The proposed barge ramp facility requires approvals from multiple regulatory agencies in addition to the City of Richmond.",

Building B and Building C will operate under the same ownership and cannot be stratified due to shared sanitary lines and water lines between the two buildings.\nNote: This is a combustible building constructed to 3.2.2.50 requirements per VBBL 2019. The childcare facility on the first floor is allowed to accommodate only 8 (eight) children in order to be considered group C major occupancy and to allow combustible construction.\nAny increase of capacity of the child care would classify this facility as A-2 major occupancy, and will require the child care to be separated by a fire separation with at least a 2 hr. fire-resistance rating constructed of concrete, masonry, or encapsulated mass timber.\n12-June-2023 - Full Construction Stage issued.\nREVISIONS:\n13-Oct-2023 - Rev#1 issued.\nChanges to shoring arrangement to south wall.\n01-Dec-2023 - Rev#2 issued.\nBuilding Permit Amendment to address sanitary upsizing for the project.",
