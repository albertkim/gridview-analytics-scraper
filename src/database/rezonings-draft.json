The proposal is to develop nine townhouse units, with vehicle access from No. 1 Road. The subject site consists of two lots located on the east side of No. 1 Road, between Blundell Road and Coldfall Road. The proposed development consists of nine townhouse units on a site that would be approximately 1,801.3 m2 (19,389 ft2) in area after the required 0.91 m wide road dedication along No. 1 Road. The proposed site layout consists of one three-storey building along the west side of the site facing No. 1 Road, two two-storey duplex buildings along the east side of the site along the interface with existing single-family housing fronting Corless Place, and an internal drive-aisle that runs north-south between the front and rear buildings. All units have an east-west orientation, with the main unit entries facing either No. 1 Road or the internal drive-aisle. Private outdoor space for the units fronting No. 1 Road is proposed primarily in the form of front yards at ground level with secondary decks on the upper levels facing either No. 1 Road or the internal drive-aisle. Private outdoor space for the two-storey units is proposed primarily in the form of rear yards. The proposal is for nine strata-titled townhouse units. Vehicle access to the site is proposed off No. 1 Road. Pedestrian access to the street-fronting units will be provided via individual pathways. On-site parking will be provided within each unit's garage. Two visitor surface parking spaces will be provided off the internal drive-aisle. Resident and visitor bike parking will be provided. A Certified Arborist's Report has been submitted, identifying trees on-site and off-site. Some trees on-site are in poor condition and should be removed and replaced. Trees on neighboring properties will be retained and protected. Tree protection measures will be implemented during the development stage. Variance requests are being sought to reduce the minimum required lot width and allow six small vehicle parking spaces. Staff is supportive of the variance requests.",

(Balraj Singh Sanghera and Rajbir Kaur Chatha), to rezone 11831/11833 Seabrook Crescent from the “Single Detached (RS1/E)” zone to the “Single Detached (RS2/B)” zone in order to permit the property to be subdivided into two single-family lots, each with vehicle access from Seabrook Crescent. The subject site contains an existing un-stratified non-conforming duplex (two-unit dwelling), which will be demolished prior to subdivision. Both dwelling units are currently tenant occupied and do not contain any secondary suites. The proposed rezoning and subdivision complies with Section 2.3.7 and would result in the creation of two single-family lots being 444.9 m2 and 450.2 m2 in area. Preliminary confirmation has been received from MOTI indicating that they have no objections to the proposed redevelopment. Final approval from MOTI is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw. A rezoning sign has been installed on the subject property. Staff have not received any comments from the public about the rezoning application in response to the placement of the rezoning sign on the property. Should the Planning Committee endorse this application and Council grant first reading to the rezoning bylaw, the bylaw will be forwarded to a Public Hearing, where any area resident or interested party will have an opportunity to comment.

Onyx Premier Homes Ltd. (Directors: Amar Gill and Jasdeep Uppal) have applied to the City of Richmond for permission to rezone 10511 Lassam Road from the \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\" zone to the \"Single Detached (RS2/B)\" zone, to permit the property to be subdivided to create two single-family lots with access from Lassam Road. A map and aerial photograph showing the location of the subject site is included in Attachment 1. The proposed subdivision is provided in Attachment 2. The subject property is located in the Steveston planning area and is designated as \"Neighbourhood Residential\" in the Official Community Plan (OCP). The property is designated for \"Single Family\" use in the Steveston Area Plan. The proposed rezoning and subdivision are consistent with these designations. The subject property is located within the area covered by Lot Size Policy 5420, adopted by City Council in 1989, and subsequently amended by Council on August 7, 1992, and on August 21, 1995 (Attachment 4). The Policy permits properties along Lassam Road to be rezoned and subdivided in accordance with the provisions of the \"Single Detached (RS2/B)\" zone (minimum 12 m wide lots). Each proposed lot at the subject site will be approximately 12.6 m (41 ft.) wide and approximately 575 m² (6,189.25 ft²) in area which conforms to the RS2/B zone. The proposed rezoning complies with the Lot Size Policy. The proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw. In accordance with the City's Early Public Notification Policy No. 1316, a notice of the development proposal was provided to residents within 100 metres of the subject site. In addition, a rezoning sign has been installed on the subject property. Staff have not received any comments from the public about the rezoning application in response to the early public notification or placement of the rezoning sign on the property. Should the Planning Committee endorse this application and Council grant first reading to the rezoning bylaw, the bylaw will be forwarded to a Public Hearing, where any area resident or interested party will have an opportunity to comment. Public notification for the Public Hearing will be provided as per the Local Government Act and the City's Zoning Bylaw 8500. This redevelopment proposes to rezone and subdivide an existing single-family lot into two new single-family lots with vehicular access for both new lots off Lassam Road. This rezoning and subdivision is consistent with the emerging lot fabric and vehicular access along Lassam Road. There is an existing 3 m wide Statutory Right-of-Way (SRW) for City sanitary service that covers a small portion of the property in the southwest corner which will be expanded and widened northward with utility upgrades. The applicant has been advised that no building encroachment into the SRW is permitted. The subject site currently has vehicular access from a driveway letdown along Lassam Road. In accordance with the Residential Lot (Vehicular) Access Regulation Bylaw 7222, vehicle access to proposed Lot 1 and proposed Lot 2 will be from Lassam Road.",

    "description": "A rezoning application has been received for the construction of a high-density mixed-tenure residential development atop a commercial/retail podium and underground parking at 4141 Lougheed Highway. The proposed zoning is to change from M1 Manufacturing District to CD Comprehensive Development District, based on RM5s Multiple Family Residential District, RM5r Multiple Family Residential District, C3 General Commercial District, and the Brentwood Town Centre Development Plan as guidelines. The proposed development plan includes two high-rise residential apartment buildings on top of a commercial/retail podium and underground parking. Vehicle access to the site is currently through 1934 Gilmore Avenue, and access to the development is proposed via a temporary street within the easement. Vehicular access will also be provided from and to the east once 4199 Lougheed Highway is redeveloped. Pedestrian access is provided from both Lougheed Highway and the future east-west street along the northern portion of the site. The development will be constructed in a single phase. The development concept involves demolishing the existing warehouse and surface parking and constructing a 62-storey residential strata building (Building A) in the northeast corner of the lot, and a 54-storey residential market and non-market rental building (Building B) in the southwest corner of the lot. Both buildings sit atop a 10-storey commercial podium, which includes a hotel with supporting amenities and ground-oriented retail units. The commercial podium allows for flexibility in occupancy, allowing the floor space to be utilized for offices or other employment generating uses as permitted within the C3 District.",

Require the posting of a sign on the subject site indicating the rezoning application and public hearing, or until all units are sold, whichever is greater.\nChief Administrative Officer's Comments: The Chief Administrative Officer concurs with the recommendation of the General Manager Planning and Development.\nExecutive Summary: A rezoning application has been received to permit the construction of a high-density mixed-tenure residential development atop a commercial/retail podium and underground parking. The purpose of this report is to provide Council with information on the proposal and recommend forwarding the rezoning application to a future Public Hearing.\nPolicy Section: The proposed rezoning application is consistent with various policies and plans adopted by Council.\nBackground: The subject site is part of the Buchanan West Master Plan and is designated for high-density mixed-use development. The site is currently improved with an older industrial warehouse building and surface parking. The initial rezoning report was received on June 20, 2022.\nDevelopment District will use RM5s Multiple Family Residential District, RM5r Multiple Family Residential District, C3 General Commercial District, and Brentwood Town Centre Development Plan as guidelines. Applicant submitted a development plan for two high-rise residential apartment buildings on top of a commercial/retail podium and underground parking. Vehicle access is currently through 1934 Gilmore Avenue and will also be provided from and to the east once 4199 Lougheed Highway is redeveloped. Pedestrian access is available from Lougheed Highway and the future east-west street on the site's northern portion. The development will be constructed in a single phase. It involves demolishing the existing warehouse and surface parking and constructing a 62-storey residential strata building (Building A) in the northeast corner and a 54-storey residential market and non-market rental building (Building B) in the southwest corner. Both buildings sit on a 10-storey commercial podium that includes a hotel(s) with amenities and retail units. The commercial podium can be used for offices or other employment generating uses if the hotel market softens in the future.",

The subject site is currently improved with a gas service station and an older two-storey office commercial building. The adopted Lougheed Core Area Master Plan is a reconceptualization of a 29.1 hectare area into a vibrant, pedestrian and transit-connected, mixed-use community with diverse housing, employment, service, and recreation opportunities. The Master Plan provides direction related to the general land use, form, massing, subdivision pattern, site servicing, development phasing, and distribution of applicable development densities in the core area. The Master Plan includes eight major development phases for the lands encompassing the Lougheed Mall and select properties to the south, including the subject site. All sites within the Master Plan are designated for high-density mixed-use development based on land uses and densities permitted under the RM5s, C3 and P2 Districts. The subject property was identified as a single tower site to accommodate the density associated with the RM5s and C3 Districts.

The proposed zoning is CD Comprehensive Development District, based on M1 Manufacturing District and M2 General Industrial District guidelines. The purpose of the rezoning is to permit a self-storage facility business model specifically for small businesses, with 872 climate-controlled storage units, bike lockers for employees, two levels of underground parking, and intensive security systems. The facility is also located within a 900 m walking distance of the Gilmore SkyTrain Station, providing access for individuals and businesses across Metro Vancouver. Concerns were raised about self-storage uses in industrial zoning districts, but the self-storage use is permitted in industrial zoning districts according to the City of Burnaby's Official Community Plan and Metro 2050 land use designations. The proposed self-storage facility aligns with the Metro Vancouver Regional Industrial Lands Strategy and City of Burnaby's Official Community Plan, aiming to intensify employment and floor space on redeveloping industrial land.",

Seek Council approval to execute and register a Statutory Right-of-Way in favor of BC Hydro over 7679 and 7701 - 18th Street to permit the installation of an overhead pole line to serve the Southgate neighborhood. The proposed rezoning application is consistent with the Corporate Strategic Plan (2022), Official Community Plan (1998), Edmonds Town Centre Plan Area (1994), Economic Development Strategy (2007), and Southgate Master Plan (2015). The City-owned properties at 7679 and 7701 - 18th Street were initially included in the Southgate Master Plan to accommodate a future road connection. However, as the properties are no longer being developed concurrently with the Southgate neighborhood, an overhead power line is proposed to serve the area. The developer will be responsible for undergrounding the line in the future. Staff will work with BC Hydro to finalize the agreement for the installation of the power line. The proposed Statutory Right-of-Way measures approximately 190 m in length and ranges in width from 8.0 m to 11.7 m. The City has not requested compensation for the Statutory Right-of-Way.

    "description": "A rezoning application has been received for the construction of a six-storey purpose built residential rental building at 5650 Beresford Street. The proposed zoning is CD Comprehensive Development District, based on RM3 Multiple Family Residential District, RM3r Multiple Family Residential District, and the Royal Oak Community Plan. The current zoning is M2 General Industrial District. The purpose of the report is to recommend forwarding the rezoning application to a future Public Hearing. The recommendations include preparing and advancing a Rezoning Bylaw to First Reading and to a Public Hearing at a future date, authorizing the introduction of a Housing Agreement Bylaw, authorizing the introduction of a Highway Closure Bylaw, approving in principle the sale of City-owned property for inclusion within the subject development site, and establishing prerequisites to the completion of the rezoning. The proposed rezoning application is consistent with various policies and plans adopted by Council. On October 04, 2021, Council approved a report seeking endorsement of a density and rental obligation transfer between the subject site (Beresford Site) and the Bassano Master Plan Site, owned by the applicant, in order to deliver a fully non-market rental project. The subject site will initially serve as rental housing for displaced tenants from development sites within the Metrotown Downtown Plan Area and beyond. The rental units will be delivered prior to or concurrently with Phase 1 of the Bassano Site. These units will satisfy the inclusionary rental requirement for Phases 1 and 2 of the Bassano Site, as well as the inclusionary requirement for the subject site. Displaced residents from other rental developments can be housed at the subject site until their unit in their new development is ready. Tenants will only be responsible for the portion of the rent equivalent to their rent at the time of rezoning, with the developer paying any applicable rent top-up. After Phase 3 of the Bassano Site is completed, the subject site's required rental units will revert to standard inclusionary rental rates, set at 20% below CMHC median market rates for the Southeast Burnaby rental survey area. Phase 3 of the Bassano Site will include a non-market rental podium to meet the overall inclusionary rental requirement for both sites. Additional voluntary rental units at the subject site or Bassano Site can be provided as a mix of market and non-market rental units on a 1:1 basis. A density transfer between the two sites is proposed to facilitate this.",

        "summary": "RZ 21-936046\nApplication by Winston Chong Architect Inc. for Rezoning at 8520, 8540 & 8560 Railway Avenue from the “Single Detached (RS1/E)” Zone to the “Low Rise Rental Apartment (ZLR47) – Railway Avenue (Blundell)” Zone. Staff Recommendation: 1. Official Community Plan Bylaw 9000, Amendment Bylaw 10479, to change the designation of 8520, 8540 & 8560 Railway Avenue from “Neighbourhood Residential” to “Apartment Residential” in Attachment 1 to Schedule 1 of Official Community Plan Bylaw 9000 (City of Richmond 2041 OCP Land Use Map), be introduced and given first reading. 2. Bylaw 10479, having been considered in conjunction with the City’s Financial Plan and Capital Program, and the Greater Vancouver Regional District Solid Waste and Liquid Waste Management Plans, is hereby found to be consistent with said programs and plans, in accordance with Section 477(3)(a) of the Local Government Act. 3. Bylaw 10479, having been considered in accordance with OCP Bylaw Preparation Consultation Policy 5043, is hereby found not to require further consultation. 4. Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500, Amendment Bylaw 10480 to create the “Low Rise Rental Apartment (ZLR47) – Railway Avenue (Blundell)” zone, and to rezone 8520, 8540 & 8560 Railway Avenue from “Single Detached (RS1/E)” to “Low Rise Rental Apartment (ZLR47) – Railway Avenue (Blundell)”, be introduced and given first reading. Origin Winston Chong Architect Inc., on behalf of SD Railway Homes Inc. and in partnership with Richmond Kiwanis Seniors Citizens Housing Society, has applied to the City of Richmond for permission to rezone 8520, 8540 & 8560 Railway Avenue (Attachment 1) from the “Single Detached (RS1/E)” zone to a new site-specific zone, “Low Rise Rental Apartment (ZLR47) – Railway Avenue (Blundell)”, in order to permit the construction of a 100 per cent rental residential apartment development consisting of a four-storey building, containing 58 units for seniors. Key components of the proposal include: - One four-storey apartment building with 58 rental units secured for seniors (55 years and older), including 29 (50 per cent) Low-End Market Rental (LEMR) units and 29 (50 per cent) market rental units. - Approximately 1,534 m2 (16,512 ft2) of purpose-built Low-End Market Rental (LEMR) housing and approximately 1,605 m2 (17,276 ft2) of purpose-built market rental housing. - All purpose-built LEMR units and market rental units will be secured in perpetuity with rental tenure zoning and housing agreements registered on Title. All units will be maintained under a single ownership. - The building will meet Energy Step Code Step 4. - Approximately 102 m2 (1,098 ft2) of indoor amenity space and 495 m2 (5,324 ft2) of shared outdoor amenity space. - Preliminary site plan, building elevations, and landscape plan are contained in Attachment 2. Road and engineering improvement works required with respect to the subject development will be secured through the City’s standard Servicing Agreement process prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw. Works including frontage improvements, servicing upgrades and upgrades to the existing City-owned public walkway along the south property line will be designed and constructed at the owner’s sole cost. Findings of Fact A Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached (Attachment 3). Subject Site Existing Housing Profile The subject site currently contains one single-family dwelling (no secondary suite) at 8520 Railway Avenue, which is vacant. 8540 and 8560 Railway Avenue contain no buildings. Surrounding Development To the North: A single-family dwelling on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”, fronting Railway Avenue. To the South: Across a City-owned public walkway, a 17-unit townhouse development (three and two storeys) (RZ 15-709884 / DP 16-754735) on a lot zoned “Town Housing (ZT80) – Railway Avenue”, fronting Railway Avenue. To the East: Single-family dwellings on lots zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”, fronting Calder Road. To the West: Across Railway Avenue and the Railway Greenway, single-family dwellings on lots zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”, fronting Lancelot Drive. Related Policies & Studies Official Community Plan The Official Community Plan (OCP) Land Use Map is proposed to be amended to change the designation of the subject site from “Neighbourhood Residential” to “Apartment Residential” in order to allow the proposal. The OCP rental housing policies support site specific density increases for developments that provide affordable and market rental housing to address community need. The proposal complies with the market rental housing policies as the project is 100 per cent rental housing with a component of affordable rental. Further details on the proposed OCP amendment are provided in the “Analysis” section of this report. Floodplain Management Implementation Strategy The proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw. Public Consultation A rezoning sign has been installed on the subject property. Staff have not received any formal comments from the public about the rezoning application in response to the placement of the rezoning sign on the property. To inform residents of the proposal, the applicant provided a notification package on May 31, 2023 to neighbouring properties with direct adjacency to the subject site, including information on density, height, site plan, elevations, and parking. The applicant has provided a map identifying the properties that were notified (Attachment 4). As of the date of this report, no correspondence has been received in response to the notification package. Should the Planning Committee endorse this application and Council grant first reading to the rezoning bylaw, the bylaw will be forwarded to a Public Hearing, where any area resident or interested party will have an opportunity to comment.",

The subject site is zoned RS-1 and located on the west side of Ash Street, at 35th Avenue. The property consists of a four-lot assembly, with a frontage of 75.6 m and a depth of 36.5 m. The total site area is 2,766.7 sq. m and is developed with four single-detached houses. The houses are all rented and the Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy applies. The surrounding area is undergoing significant change, with new four- and six-storey buildings approved or under construction. The portion of the 21-acre Heather Lands project directly across the lane is approved for market strata development with heights from 6 to 18 storeys. The Vancouver Plan and Cambie Corridor Plan support strata buildings up to four storeys and 2.0 FSR. However, increased height to six storeys will be considered for road dedication. A new 35th Avenue road extension is anticipated to connect Queen Elizabeth Park to the Heather Lands. This zoning amendment would allow for a six-storey residential building with 62 strata-titled units. The building would have a height of 21.4 m (70 ft.), a floor area of 5,533.4 sq. m (59,561 sq. ft.), and a floor space ratio (FSR) of 2.0. Ground-level units would face Ash Street, with underground parking accessed from the lane.

Require signage indicating the availability of affordable housing units to be posted at the time of First Reading, or at the time marketing for the subject development commences, and remain posted for a period of one year, or until all units are sold. Chief Administrative Officer’s Comments: Concur with the recommendation of the General Manager Planning and Development. Executive Summary: Rezoning application received for high-density mixed-use development. Recommend forwarding application to future Public Hearing. Policy Section: Proposed rezoning application consistent with various policies and plans adopted by Council. Background: Subject development site located in Maywood neighbourhood of Metrotown Downtown Plan area. Plan identifies neighbourhood as residential \"heart\" of Metrotown with high-density multiple-family development. Subject properties designated for high-density mixed-use development under Comprehensive Development District. The development proposal aligns with permitted C2 commercial densities. The rationale for including the C3 General Commercial District as guidelines is explained in Section 3.5. On April 27, 2020, Council received a rezoning report for the four properties (6645, 6659, 6675, and 6691 Dow Avenue) in line with the adopted Plan. Council authorized staff to work with the applicant to create a suitable development plan. On October 25, 2021, Staff provided an expanded site report to Council, informing them of the applicant's intention to revise their original proposal to include the property at 6707 Dow Avenue. This property is designated for high-density multiple family residential development in the adopted Metrotown Downtown Plan. Council authorized staff to continue working with the applicant to develop a plan that includes this additional property. The proposed development site consists of five lots and follows guidelines from the RM5s, RM5r, RM4s, and RM4r Districts. The maximum permitted density for the redevelopment of the subject site is calculated based on the proportions of the different residential designations on the consolidated site. The existing rental apartment buildings on the subject properties were built between 1955 and 1964 and have two to three storeys. There are currently 112 rental units across the five sites. Vehicular access to 6645 Dow Avenue is from a rear lane, while access to the other four properties is from Dow Avenue. The proposed CD Comprehensive Development District zoning includes the RM5r and RM4r Multiple Family Residential Districts to support the replacement of existing rental units and meet the City's Rental Use Zoning Policy requirements.",

The revised proposal includes the property at 4370 Kingsway, expanding the subject site to cover the entire block bounded by Kingsway, Kathleen Avenue, Kemp Street, and Wilson Avenue. The revised proposal would replace the existing 10-storey commercial office building at the southeast corner of the site with a high-density mixed-use building comprised of both market and non-market dwelling units, and street-activating retail uses.

    "description": "Ajit Aujla and New Villa Holdings have applied to rezone 8491 No. 4 Road from the 'Single Detached (RS1/E)' zone to a new site-specific zone, 'Coach House (ZS31) - No. 4 Road'. The proposed rezoning would permit the property to be subdivided to create two lots, each with a principal dwelling and an accessory coach house above a detached garage, with vehicle access from the existing rear lane. The proposed site-specific zone is identical in all provisions to the standard 'Coach Houses (RCH1)' zone, but allows for a reduced lot depth. The existing single-family dwelling on the property is proposed to be demolished. The surrounding development consists of single-family dwellings on lots zoned 'Single Detached (RS1/E)' and 'Compact Single Detached (RC1)' fronting No. 4 Road, as well as single-family dwellings on agricultural lots included in the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR), zoned 'Agriculture (AG1)'. The proposal is consistent with the Official Community Plan (OCP) land use designation for the subject site and the Arterial Road Land Use Policy. The applicant is required to register a legal agreement on Title to ensure that a 4.0 m wide landscaped Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR) buffer along No. 4 Road is maintained and will not be abandoned or removed, and to meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204.",

Staff recommend referring the application to a Public Hearing with the recommendation to approve it in principle, subject to conditions. The subject site is comprised of three legal parcels fronting East 18th Avenue. The total site area is approximately 1,118 sq. m (12,034 sq. ft.) with a frontage of 30 m (98.4 ft.) along East 18th Avenue and a depth of 37.5 m (123 ft.). The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under SRP for four-storey buildings. In December 2021, Council approved the addition of new residential rental (\"RR\") zoning district schedules to the Zoning & Development By-law; RR-1, RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C, and RR-3A and RR-3B. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed. Further direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines. The guidelines support new missing middle buildings that foster neighbourliness and social connection and contribute to an evolving streetscape which accommodates more architectural variety and diversity of housing options.",

The rezoning application implements Council-approved direction in the Plan and is supported by data and findings within the Housing Needs Report. The rezoning to RM-8A/AN follows a simplified process, with architectural drawings not required at the rezoning stage. The site is well served by public transit, including the King Edward Avenue Canada Line Station, and nearby bikeways provide sustainable transportation options.

The property is located at the northeast corner of 28th Avenue and Heather Street, with an area of approximately 657 sq. m (7,072 sq. ft.) and a frontage of 17 m (57 ft.) along 28th Avenue. The Vancouver Plan and Cambie Corridor Plan guide the development of the area, supporting residential townhouses or rowhouses with a maximum FSR of 1.20. The subject site is located within the Queen Elizabeth neighbourhood, which calls for new townhouses in transition areas. The rezoning application implements Council-approved direction in the Plan and is supported by data and findings within the Housing Needs Report. The rezoning to RM-8A/AN follows a simplified process, with architectural drawings not required at the rezoning stage. The site is well served by public transit, including the King Edward Avenue Canada Line Station, and nearby bikeways provide sustainable transportation options. Parking, loading, and bicycle spaces are reviewed during the DP process, with upgrades required as per the Parking By-law.",

Subsequently, the land owner and the City entered into a Housing Agreement (the “Original Housing Agreement”) for one lot that is within the development lands, being the lot legally described as Lot A Block 7 District Lot 311 Group 1 New Westminster District Plan EPP115039, as approved under By-law No. 13361 and thereafter the rezoning by-law was enacted on July 20, 2022 under By-law No. 13475 (the “Rezoning By-law”). The land owner subsequently elected not to pursue a DCL waiver and accordingly, requested that the Original Housing Agreement be amended or replaced to secure market rental housing instead of For-Profit Affordable Rental Housing. As such, the land owner and the City entered into a replacement Housing Agreement (the “New Housing Agreement”), as authorized under By-law No. 13573, the New Housing Agreement was registered at the Land Title Office under registration No. CB350890 to CB350891.
