The result will provide a wider space between the rear units of the subject development and the single-family dwellings that back onto the subject site. It will also provide a larger buffer to accommodate tree retention along the rear property line. The resulting distance from the back of the curb to the building face would be approximately 8.47 m. The reduced front yard setback does not compromise tree preservation or tree planting opportunities along the site frontage. The proposed architectural design provides appropriate building articulation and interface with neighboring properties. To address the road traffic noise from Steveston Highway, the project acoustical engineer confirmed that the proposed development is designed to meet the interior noise limits as per the CMHC standards. This variance was identified at the rezoning stage, and no concerns were identified at that time.",
