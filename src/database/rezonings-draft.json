The purpose of this report is to provide Council with information on the proposal and recommend forwarding the rezoning application to a future Public Hearing. The proposed development district will use RM5s Multiple Family Residential District, RM5r Multiple Family Residential District, C3 General Commercial District, and Brentwood Town Centre Development Plan as guidelines. The applicant submitted a development plan for two high-rise residential apartment buildings on top of a commercial/retail podium and underground parking. Vehicle access is currently through 1934 Gilmore Avenue and will also be provided from and to the east once 4199 Lougheed Highway is redeveloped. Pedestrian access is available from Lougheed Highway and the future east-west street on the site's northern portion. The development will be constructed in a single phase. It involves demolishing the existing warehouse and surface parking and constructing a 62-storey residential strata building (Building A) in the northeast corner and a 54-storey residential market and non-market rental building (Building B) in the southwest corner. Both buildings sit on a 10-storey commercial podium that includes a hotel(s) with amenities and retail units. The commercial podium can be used for offices or other employment generating uses if the hotel market softens in the future.",
