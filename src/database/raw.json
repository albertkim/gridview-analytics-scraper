    "contents": "PORT ALBERNI – Seniors and people living with disabilities in Port Alberni now have access to more affordable rental housing with the opening of Huupsitas, a new 48-unit apartment building.“The Huupsitas building will provide the kind of stability and security that seniors and people living with disabilities need more of, so they can retire in the community they know and love,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “Our government is building housing at a historic rate, and these 48 new homes are another example of how we’re building a province where everyone has a good place to call home and no one gets left behind.”Located at 6161 Russell Pl., the five-storey building has 45 one-bedroom units and three two-bedroom apartments. The WestCoast Native Health Care Society contributed the land for the building, which forms part of the five-acre Tsawaayuus Rainbow Gardens Campus of Care. The site is home to a 44-unit complex care facility and a 20-unit independent living apartment building.“Accessible housing like this is part of our commitment to ensure people can continue to live affordably, and close to family, community and culture,” said Josie Osborne, MLA for Mid Island-Pacific. “Our government shares the community’s excitement in seeing these homes opened, and we will continue to work with our partners to support housing needs for seniors and people living with disabilities.”Huupsitas provides independent seniors with the ability to age in place. Half the units have their rent geared to income where rent is 30% of the tenant’s income. Nine units will be rented to households with very low incomes, such as those receiving income or disability assistance or a basic senior’s pension. The remaining units will be rented at the low end of market rents, between $750 for a one-bedroom and $850 for a two-bedroom. Ten of the units are fully wheelchair accessible, while the remaining units can be easily adapted if a tenant’s accessibility needs change in the future. The building is open to both Indigenous and non-Indigenous residents.This project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes delivered or underway, including nearly 480 homes in Port Alberni.Quotes:Margaret Pfoh, CEO, Aboriginal Housing Management Association –“Enabling this housing is a much-needed act of reconciliACTION. This development provides equitable access to safe, affordable, culturally supported living for Indigenous elders. A place to call home is essential for the well-being of all Indigenous youth, families, elders and peoples.”Derek Appleton, chair, WestCoast Native Health Care Society –“We are very pleased with the support from the provincial government to add to our campus of care. Residents in the existing affordable living apartments have had a life-changing experience moving into the new building where a community of tenants has formed. A home and a wholesome connection to other human beings is conducive to well-being for everyone.”Sharie Minions, mayor, City of Port Alberni –“The opening of Huupsitas will ensure our seniors have access to affordable, stable housing and are able to age in place in a community they love. My gratitude goes out to the WestCoast Native Health Care Society who continue to do great work advocating for independent seniors and Indigenous elders in our community.”Quick Facts:\n\tHuupsitas translates to “side of a hill” in Nuu-chah-nulth.\n\tThe Province, through BC Housing, provided approximately $5 million to the project through the Building BC: Community Housing Fund and will provide about $300,000 in annual operating funding.\n\tThe Community Housing Fund is a 10-year, $3.3-billion investment to build more than 20,000 affordable rental homes for people with low or moderate incomes.\nLearn More:To learn more about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/",

The housing is operated by Lookout Housing and Health Society, which provides residents with daily meals, and health and wellness supports. The Village opened at a different site as a pilot project by the Cowichan Housing Association to provide immediate housing for vulnerable people during the COVID-19 pandemic. It moved to the Trunk Road property in 2022.“The Village opened in July 2020 and continues to improve as we learn and adapt,” said Michelle Staples, mayor of Duncan. “What began as a pandemic response has grown into a culturally safe wellness and recovery model. This site fills an essential gap in the continuum of housing and the city is pleased to receive continued support from the Province.”The extension is being funded through the Province’s newly established Homelessness Encampment Action Response Temporary Housing (HEARTH) program. HEARTH provides emergency housing, shelter options and immediate co-ordinated supports to help people in encampments or sheltering in public spaces to move indoors and access temporary or permanent housing options that fit their needs.Residents at The Village will eventually move to permanent supportive housing under construction in the community. The project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway, including more than 350 homes in Duncan.Quotes:Doug Routley, MLA for Nanaimo-North Cowichan –“The Village has brought vulnerable people safely indoors and connected them with services so they have supports they need to begin to rebuild their lives. Our work doesn’t stop here. I look forward to continuing to work with the Cowichan community on permanent housing solutions for people in our community.”Shayne Williams, CEO, Lookout Housing and Health Society –“Lookout Housing and Health Society is proud to operate The Village, which provides safe and healthy housing for some of our communities most vulnerable in Duncan. Lookout is honoured to partner with BC Housing and the City of Duncan on this successful housing model that demonstrates better health outcomes for those who call The Village their home.”Rob Douglas, mayor, North Cowichan –“Funding for the continued operation of The Village will not only benefit Duncan, but also North Cowichan and the broader Cowichan region. Through temporary housing and extensive supports, this model has proven successful in helping people facing homelessness to get back on their feet, improve their health and well-being, and access services.”Quick Facts:\n\tThe Province, through BC Housing, will provide approximately $1.5 million in annual operating funding for the Village through Dec. 31, 2026.\n\tThe HEARTH program is part of Belonging in BC, the Province's plan to prevent and reduce homelessness.\n\tThe plan will also add thousands of new supportive housing units and hundreds of complex-care spaces provincewide.\n\tBC Housing provided the land for the project, which will be used in the future for an affordable housing development.\n\tThe housing structures are owned by Cowichan Housing Association.\nLearn More:To learn more about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436A map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C. is available online: https://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/",

The Crowley Avenue project is anticipated to be complete and have residents moving in February 2024. The Highway 97 North project is anticipated to be complete by March 2024. The sites are on land owned by the City of Kelowna, which will lease the land to the Province for a nominal fee.“We appreciate the collaboration and partnership from the Province and BC Housing to advance this work quickly,” said Tom Dyas, mayor of Kelowna. “John Howard and Turning Points are both experienced and established operators, and valued partners.  With the cold season here, we look forward to seeing these sites open as soon as possible.”The societies will provide support services such as daily meals, 24/7 staffing, access to skills training and support navigating the housing system. Individuals moving into these homes will be assessed and matched with appropriate supports.The two projects are intended as temporary housing solutions, providing time for BC Housing to continue working with the City of Kelowna to identify and build new permanent supportive housing.The Province has more than 77,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway throughout the province, such as more than 1,700 homes in Kelowna.The Province and the City of Kelowna recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that formalizes their commitment to work together to better support people who are unhoused, sheltering in encampments and to help prevent future encampments.

We are proud of the work we are doing with partners like BC Housing to improve our community.”Old Massett Village Council will own and operate the two-storey building, which includes six one-bedroom and six two-bedroom units to provide much-needed off-reserve homes. The villages of Old Massett and Masset are located near to each other on the northern shore of Graham Island, the largest and northernmost island of Haida Gwaii.“We’ve purchased this building so that people can continue to live affordably, close to family, community and culture,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “Preserving and improving affordable housing in both rural and urban communities is an important part of our government’s housing plan and today’s announcement is the latest milestone in work to deliver homes for people.”Eight of the 12 units will be operated as near-market rental housing geared to middle-income households. The remaining four units will be for families with low incomes, with rents set at 30% of the household’s income.“I am proud that our government took action to secure these affordable rental homes in Massett so they can be preserved for the long term,” said Jennifer Rice, MLA for North Coast. “These homes provide a sense of well-being and a place for many to call home, and we will continue to work with Indigenous partners to build on- and off-reserve housing.”  The Province, through BC Housing, is providing $4 million to purchase and renovate the vacant building.

We will continue to work in partnership with organizations like the Haven Society to provide the safety, supports and services that can help rebuild people’s lives.”The four-storey, wood-frame building will provide 30 self-contained second-stage housing units with their own bathroom and kitchen, as well as 10 rooms with a total of 17 transition beds for short-term stays. Three second-stage housing units and one transition room will be wheelchair accessible.The housing will be operated by Haven Society, which supports adults and children leaving gender-based violence. This new building will replace an ageing 17-unit transition home operated by Haven Society. Once construction is finished, Haven will transfer its services and programming to the new building, which has a communal kitchen, amenity room and expanded programming spaces. The building is also close to public parks and a public recreation centre.“No one should feel unsafe in their home and their community. Yet too many women and gender-diverse people continue to face obstacles after leaving intimate-partner violence,” said Kelli Paddon, Parliamentary Secretary for Gender Equity. “These new transition and second-stage homes will offer much-needed support through programming and living arrangements to survivors and their children as they work to rebuild their lives in a safe and compassionate space.”Transition housing provides safe, temporary shelter with supports for people who need a place to go after leaving a violent or abusive situation. After a stay in a transition house, guests can move to second-stage housing for approximately six to 18 months before moving to more permanent housing in the community. Second-stage housing includes services to help women rebuild their independence, including support groups, system navigation and individualized assistance.Construction is expected to be completed in fall 2024.This project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government.

The project estimates the number of people who experienced homelessness in the province.As the data grows, it allows government to make evidence-based decisions on what services and supports are needed most to prevent or end the cycle for people experiencing homelessness in B.C.The report adds another year of data to the 2020 and 2019 estimates that were released last year. This project links de-identified data from the Ministry of Social Development and Poverty Reduction, the Ministry of Health and BC Housing to estimate the number of people who have experienced homelessness in B.C.With an updated data set for 2021, analysts can begin to see the emergence of some patterns. The numbers offer the ability to monitor seasonal and geographic trends, and demographics of individuals in B.C. who experience homelessness.According to the research, the latest findings show:\n\t11,896 people, on average, were identified as experiencing homelessness each month, (range = 11,331 in February to 12,758 in December).\n\t26,240 people experienced homelessness in B.C. at some point in 2021. In comparison, 24,270 people experienced homelessness at some point in 2020, and 24,507 people experienced homelessness at some point in 2019.\n\t10,424 people were newly identified in 2021 as not having experienced homelessness in 2020 or 2019, while 10,013 people who had experienced homelesness in 2020 did not meet the definition of experiencing it again in 2021.\nThe data counts people who accessed income assistance and people who reported having no fixed address and people who accessed a shelter over the course of 2021. The data also shows where people are experiencing homelessness, whether their homelessness was short term or chronic, and examines when people enter and exit homelessness.Government is using this data to implement Belonging in BC, the Province’s plan to prevent and reduce homelessness. The plan adds thousands of new supportive housing units and hundreds of complex-care spaces provincewide, and creates multidisciplinary regional response teams designed to rapidly respond to encampments to better support people sheltering outdoors to move inside.Quick Facts:\n\tThe Belonging in BC homelessness plan is delivered through initiatives across government and supported by investments of $1.18 billion in Budget 2023 and $633 million in Budget 2022.\n\tSince 2017, government has helped approximately 5,600 people who were experiencing, or at risk of, homelessness move into new supportive housing.\n\tAnother 2,300 supportive homes are underway, including approximately 860 homes coming to Vancouver and 250 in Victoria.\n\tIn addition, the Province is funding more than 5,500 shelter spaces in 55 communities throughout the province this winter, including permanent, temporary and extreme-weather response shelters.\nLearn More: To view the full report and find out more about what the Province is doing to help prevent homelessness, visit:\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/affordable-and-social-housing/homelessness/homelessness-cohort",

The building is also pet-friendly, allowing cats and small dogs.This project is the result of a partnership between the Province, through BC Housing, the federal government, through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the Capital Regional District, and M’akola Housing Society.“Through the National Housing Strategy, we are investing in affordable housing across the country, including right here in Sooke,” said Sean Fraser, federal Minister of Housing, Infrastructure and Communities. “I am proud that we supported these 75 new homes, which mark a new chapter for those who will live in them. Everyone deserves a safe place to call home and we are committed to making that a reality for all Canadians.”M’akola Housing Society will operate the building and will prioritize Indigenous individuals, seniors and families for the homes. Non-Indigenous residents are also welcome. People started moving into their new homes in October 2023.“These affordable homes are a tremendous help to people who are already struggling to get by,” said Ravi Parmar, MLA for Langford-Juan de Fuca. “Affordable Indigenous housing is needed all over the province. We are grateful to partners involved for bringing these homes to Sooke, so people can stay in the community they call home.”This project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes delivered or underway, including 278 homes in Sooke.Quotes: Jonathan Wilkinson, federal Minister of Energy and Natural Resources –“The Government of Canada is pleased to have supported this important development in Sooke. We are committed to making communities stronger through projects such as these here in British Columbia and across Canada. Not only do these investments help create new jobs and stimulate the local economy, they also help to provide access to secure and affordable homes for community members. This collaborative effort is helping to ensure that more individuals have a place they can call home.”Margaret Pfoh, CEO, Aboriginal Housing Management Association (AHMA) –“AHMA celebrates our member, M’akola, for its tireless efforts to collaboratively provide safe, affordable, culturally supported Indigenous housing. Housing is a central social determinant of health and well-being so there is no better investment that can be made in social equity. Indigenous people are 13 times more likely than non-Indigenous people to experience homelessness and that is not acceptable.”Kevin Albers, CEO, M'akola Housing Society –“The availability of Indigenous affordable housing is crucial for the well-being of families and communities. It provides a sense of security and stability, which is essential for people and communities to thrive. The Charters Road project is a testament to the power of the partnerships and collaboration between BC Housing, the Capital Regional District, the District of Sooke, M’akola Housing Society and M’akola Development Services.”Maja Tait, mayor, Sooke –“Today, we’re recognizing a major milestone in bringing much-needed below-market housing to our community. I want to thank the provincial government and M’akola Housing Society for their funding and support – responding to the needs of Sooke. Along with the housing project, the supporting infrastructure contributions being made through this project are helping us add a critical pedestrian corridor, impacting not only the residents living at 2170 Charters Road, but so many more in our community.”Colin Plant, chair, Capital Regional District board –“The Charters development was, in part, made possible through a grant from the Regional Housing Trust Fund (RHTF) to go toward the development of affordable housing units in the region. It’s also a demonstration of the successful application of the RHTF partnership between local, provincial and federal governments, the kind of collaboration we need in order to build more buildings like Charters to address our ongoing housing crisis.”Learn More:To learn about B.C.’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/For the most requested Government of Canada housing information, visit: https://www.canada.ca/en/services/finance/manage/housing.htmlTo find out about the National Housing Strategy, visit: http://www.placetocallhome.ca/For information about Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, visit: https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/A backgrounder follows.\n\tThe Province, through BC Housing, provided approximately $5.6 million for the project, including:\n\t\t$4.5 million through the Provincial Investment in Affordable Housing fund; and\n\t\tMore than $1.1 million from the Investment in Housing Innovation fund.\n\t\n\tM’akola Housing Society provided more than $5 million in equity.\n\tThe federal government provided $3.75 million through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation’s National Housing Co-Investment Fund.\n\tA $838,668 contribution of joint funding through the Canada-British Columbia Bilateral Agreement under the National Housing Strategy also went toward the project.\n\tThe Capital Regional District provided $330,000 through the Regional Housing Trust Fund.",

    "contents": "VICTORIA – Renters and landlords in B.C. are seeing faster and more efficient residential tenancy dispute resolutions thanks to government’s recent service improvements.“Nothing is more frustrating for renters and landlords than when the relationship breaks down. It is vitally important that they get clear resolutions faster,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “That’s why we have made significant investments to improve wait times. We have made great strides over this past year to address these issues with exceptional results. The actions we are taking will only continue to speed up service and increase user clarity as we work towards ensuring that renters and landlords can easily access the services they need.”Dispute resolution services at the Province’s Residential Tenancy Branch (RTB) have substantially improved in several ways over the last year, including:\n\ta 48% reduction in all tenancy dispute hearing wait times, including down to nine weeks for a standard hearing from about 16 weeks a year ago;\n\tdispute resolution application processing times take, on average, about 1.4 days compared to nearly 10 days in November 2022;\n\tthe average wait time for service by phone is now less than seven minutes compared to more than 17 minutes last November; and\n\tresponse times to general emails now take an average of one business day.\nThese improvements have occurred despite increases in both dispute applications and inquiries. The RTB saw a 10% increase in applications in 2023, averaging 2,005 applications per month, compared to an average of 1,811 per month in 2022.“Going through a residential tenancy dispute process should be as easy, fast and hassle-free as possible, especially as this is already a stressful situation for tenants who simply want their homes to be safe, secure and stable,” said Spencer Chandra Herbert, premier’s liaison for renters. “These improvements to processes and faster service are a great step in the right direction as we work to better support B.C. tenants in ensuring they have the dependable homes they need and deserve.” The improved services are the result of approximately $15.6 million in additional funding, a 40% budget increase, the Province committed to the RTB in December 2022 to speed up and strengthen residential tenancy dispute resolution. The budget increase allowed the RTB to create nearly 50 full-time staff positions, including a doubling of the size of the Compliance and Enforcement Unit. The expanded capacity has allowed the unit to intervene more quickly to resolve issues that affect the livelihood of tenants and landlords in cases where serious and repeated violations of the Residential Tenancy Act occur.“Timely access to justice at the Residential Tenancy Branch is critical for both landlords and tenants,” said David Hutniak, CEO, LandlordBC. “While there’s more work to be done, members have been telling us that they are seeing promising improvements to wait times. LandlordBC looks forward to continuing to collaborate with the branch to build upon these early encouraging results.”Alongside improvements to wait times, the RTB has also launched updated web content as part of the Province’s continued commitment to make the branch’s services and information more accessible to tenants and landlords. The new website, which launched Dec. 7, was designed by asking users what was and was not working. With this feedback, the Province created user-focused and easier-to-navigate web content that supports efficient access to information and dispute-resolution services for tenants and landlords.This updated web content adds to the RTB’s expanding toolkit of accessibility services, such as the recent launch of real-time interpretation for branch services in more than 200 languages. From April to October 2023, interpreter services were accessed in 134 calls and 97 hearings, spanning from American Sign Language to 14 other languages, including Arabic, French, Farsi, Hindi and Cantonese. The demand for these immediate and scheduled interpreter services has risen consistently since the launch of the service in April.The RTB will continue to revitalize its tenancy dispute and investigation processes by improving service accessibility and increasing procedural efficiency. The work is part of the Province’s $19-billion housing investment. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway.\nLearn More:To see the updated Residential Tenancy Branch web content, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/residential-tenanciesTo learn more about the Residential Tenancy Branch offering service in more than 200 languages, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0060-000874To learn more about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housingTwo backgrounders follow.\n\tThe RTB’s improved and faster services build on multiple actions the Province has taken to better protect renters since 2017, including:\n\t\tcapping rent increases below inflation at 3.5% in 2024;\n\t\tbanning illegal “renovictions”, which are evictions carried out to renovate or repair a rental unit;\n\t\tlaunching Canada’s first provincewide rent bank;\n\t\tclosing the fixed-term lease loophole;\n\t\tending all strata rental-restriction bylaws; and\n\t\tlimiting age-restriction bylaws in strata housing, except for people 55 and older.\n\t\nEach year, the Residential Tenancy Branch (RTB) receives approximately 200,000 calls requesting information or assistance and more than 20,000 applications for dispute resolution.To ensure that the Province, through the RTB, is meeting the needs and desired outcomes of a high volume of tenants and landlords, further improvements have been undertaken in addition to new web content and increased staffing. This includes procedural improvements to increase efficiency while maintaining procedural fairness, a reduced need for hearings through the compliance and enforcement unit in addition to recent legislative amendments.Additional procedural enhancements\n\tProcedural enhancements to increase efficiency include the following:\n\t\tthe implementation of a dispute stream that fast-tracks time-sensitive applications, such as unpaid rent or utilities, providing landlords with faster access to services when they have not received payment;\n\t\tan expansion of the types of disputes eligible for direct request to include tenancies ending with cause allowing for faster resolutions. Direct requests are used for straightforward applications where the other party does not dispute the application and, as a result, a full hearing is not required. This frees up hearing slots for other cases. Direct request wait times dropped by nearly 84% in November 2023 compared to November 2022;\n\t\tan expansion of the grounds for review to allow the RTB to undertake a review where it is clear an error has been made without having to send it to judicial review reducing costs to tenants and landlords, the courts and government; and\n\t\tenhanced screening for all dispute applications to improve efficiency and reduce delays for tenants and landlords by ensuring all information is accurate and complete and that all prior required steps were taken before an application is set for a hearing.\n\t\nCompliance and Enforcement Unit (CEU) improvements\n\tIn 2023, 386 complaints were received by the CEU.\n\tWith its expanded capacity, the CEU initiated 51 investigations and issued 14 monetary penalties totalling $56,200. Many of these complaints were resolved by voluntary compliance without the need for an investigation.\n\tWith these interventions, the need for hearings were often avoided allowing the RTB to better direct their resources.\nAmendments to Residential Tenancy Act/Manufactured Home Park Tenancy Act\n\tThe Residential Tenancy Act/Manufactured Home Park Tenancy Act amendments in Bill 42 received Royal Assent in November 2023.\n\tThe amendments provide several procedural improvements that increase efficiency and timeliness in all phases of the RTB’s dispute-resolution process by allowing more flexibility around procedural requirements, including new initiatives such the ability to provide decisions orally rather than in written format.\nApplication of enhanced residential tenancy services to the Squamish First Nation\n\tAs a result of a recent agreement with Squamish First Nation (SFN), the Residential Tenancy Act now applies on SFN lands. This is an important step toward reconciliation.\n\tWith this change, tenants and landlords residing on SFN lands will also have access to RTB protections with greater ease and efficiency in instances where a Squamish-led facilitation process has not been successful in resolving the dispute.\n\tRTB staff are all undertaking cultural competency training and the branch is working closely with SFN to implement this change.",

There is a mix of one-bedroom, one-bedroom-plus-den, three- and four-bedroom homes to support families of different sizes. The homes are built on the kʷikʷəƛ̓əm First Nation’s ancient village site, now called slakəyánc, which means “young sockeye” in the Nation’s hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓ language. Approximately 36% of the Nation’s members make their home at slakəyánc.“With this opening, more people from the kʷikʷəƛ̓əm First Nation can live in their home community connected to family and culture,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “As the first province in the country to invest in on-Nation housing, our government is proud to be partnering with the Nation to build these new affordable homes for their members. I look forward to seeing the impact this development will have on the community for years to come.”The project is the result of a partnership between the kʷikʷəƛ̓əm First Nation, the Province through BC Housing, and the Government of Canada through Indigenous Services Canada.“Communities are stronger when people can grow up there, raise a family and age in place,” said Fin Donnelly, MLA for Coquitlam-Burke Mountain. “Thank you to the kʷikʷəƛ̓əm Nation for their leadership in building these homes. These types of partnerships are one way our government is addressing the housing crisis. We will continue to partner with First Nations to create housing, on  and off reserve, throughout B.C.”These homes are the first project to be completed by the kʷikʷəƛ̓əm First Nation (KFN) under its historic Land Code passed in 2020, which transferred the management of reserve lands from the Government of Canada back to the Nation. The federal government had managed these lands since 1876.“My congratulations to the kʷikʷəƛ̓əm First Nation for their leadership and work to deliver these safe, secure and urgently needed homes for their members,” said Selina Robinson, MLA for Coquitlam-Maillardville. “This development benefits the whole community, with more homes for people who are looking for an affordable place to live without having to leave the surrounding area.”The housing will be operated by the KFN Housing Society, a non-profit housing provider owned by the Nation. Monthly rents range from $500 for a one-bedroom home to $1,200 for a four-bedroom home. Tenants are expected to move into their new homes in January 2024.This project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government.

They are an important step towards ensuring everyone in the community has permanent, secure housing.”The shelter is open year-round, 24 hours a day and provides 25 beds for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness in the community, as well as daily meals and support services. The Canadian Mental Health Association Shuswap Revelstoke (CMHA-SR) is operating the shelter.The Province, through BC Housing, and the City of Salmon Arm worked together to open the modular shelter on a city-owned lot. BC Housing and the city negotiated a lease on the site for 10 years, with an option to extend for another five years. BC Housing will provide approximately $1.5 million in annual operating funding for the shelter.“Access to safe, low-barrier shelter for the unhoused is a vital component of a healthy community,” said Alan Harrison, mayor of Salmon Arm. “Providing a warm, safe place to stay is the first step in helping people move forward. The City of Salmon Arm is grateful for the work of BC Housing and CMHA for helping to make that a reality.”The shelter repurposes pre-existing modular units, allowing it to be built quickly and at a lower cost.“We are pleased to open the Marshlands shelter, and that unhoused individuals in our community will have access to year-round 24/7 shelter services,” said Dawn Dunlop, executive director of CMHA-SR. “Marshlands will connect individuals to resources and supports, that will foster individuals moving into permanent stable housing.”As part of government’s new Homes for People action plan, the Province is implementing a new homelessness framework, Belonging in BC, to prevent and reduce homelessness. While shelters provide immediate relief to people experiencing homelessness and benefit the community by bringing residents indoors, they are only one part of the housing system. Moving people into permanent, stable housing benefits everyone.

    "contents": "BURNABY – Proposed changes to the building code will expand the use of mass timber to build taller buildings and to make stronger communities.These changes will allow buildings, such as schools, shopping centres and housing to be built faster, leading to a better environment and economy.“These proposed mass timber building code changes align with our recent work to deliver more homes near transit hubs by allowing taller buildings and more sustainable housing options near transit,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “These changes will also help reduce carbon pollution, support the forestry sector, create jobs, build more homes and lead to more vibrant, healthier communities.”The proposed code changes to the British Columbia Building and Fire Codes (BC Codes 2024) would enable taller mass timber buildings, as many as 18 storeys for residential and office buildings, instead of the current 12-storey limit. The changes would also allow for more exposed mass timber or fewer layers of encapsulation in buildings, depending on a building’s height, and allow more building types, such as schools, shopping centres and industrial facilities, to be built using mass timber.“Mass timber is a strong, clean building technology, and with these changes we can create astonishing buildings that display our world-class mass timber sector,” said Brenda Bailey, Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Innovation. “Through our Mass Timber Action Plan, we are investing in mass timber training and finding new avenues to grow our economy while reducing our environmental impact.”The proposed changes are posted for public comment on the Canadian Board for Harmonized Construction Codes website. After the comment period, the B.C. government will decide on what changes are ready to move forward and what changes, if any, need further technical analysis. Key changes are expected to be adopted as soon as spring 2024.B.C. and Quebec spearheaded a joint task group to develop the proposed code changes on an accelerated timeline to expand mass timber in Canada. Once the public comment period is complete, a package of proposed code changes will be made available to provinces and territories to consider for adoption in their codes, and for future consideration for the national building codes. These proposed changes have also been reviewed by an expert technical advisory group made up of fire safety experts, regulators, engineering and building code experts from across Canada.Increasing the opportunities for mass timber construction comes at the same time the Province is addressing the housing crisis through its Homes for People action plan. New laws introduced this fall will increase density in urban areas through small-scale multi-unit housing and transit-oriented development, creating more mass timber opportunities to build homes more quickly with a lower carbon footprint.This project builds on the government’s work to streamline and expedite provincial housing permits and authorizations, while stimulating economic growth. It is also part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes delivered or underway.\nQuotes:Linda Buchanan, mayor, City of North Vancouver –“We all want innovative, efficient and cost-effective ways to address our overlapping housing and climate crises. The City of North Vancouver has long been a leader in leveraging mass timber technology to tackle these challenges. We welcome these proposed changes to the BC Building Code, as they will allow communities to deliver more homes faster, unlock a new era of design possibilities and reduce carbon emissions.”Guido Wimmers, dean, British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) school of construction and the environment –“BCIT is delivering relevant, hands-on training to help learners master in-demand skills for the mass timber sector.

These regulations will help local governments work with homebuilders to deliver viable housing projects, that help more people find homes in existing neighbourhoods and next to transit hubs.”Bill 35 – Short-Term Rental Accommodations Act:Like many jurisdictions around the world, B.C. is regulating short-term rentals to turn more units into long-term homes for people. The new rules give local governments stronger enforcement tools, restrict short-term rentals to principal residences and either a secondary suite or an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) in many B.C. communities, and establish a new provincial role in regulating short-term rentals.Regulations define what constitutes a principal residence, list the communities where the principal-residency requirement applies and detail accommodation-service providers that will be exempt from the principal-residence requirement, such as some strata-titled hotels and motels, fishing/hunting lodges and time shares.The guidelines also provide additional details, including how local governments can annually request by resolution to the Province to “opt out” of the principal-residence requirement if the community has a rental-vacancy rate of 3% or more for two consecutive years, and assist local governments applying the new provincial legislation alongside existing local government short-term rental bylaws.Bill 44 – Housing Statutes (Residential Development) Amendment Act:Historical zoning rules in many B.C. communities have resulted in new housing being mostly in the form of condos or single-family homes that are out of reach for many people, leaving a shortage of options for the types of housing in between. Zoning barriers and layers of regulations have also slowed down the delivery of housing, making people go through long, complicated processes to build much-needed housing in communities.The regulations detail requirements for local governments to update zoning bylaws to allow either a minimum of one secondary suite or detached accessory dwelling unit, a minimum of three to four dwelling units, or a minimum of six dwelling units in selected areas near bus stops with frequent transit service.  The Small-Scale Multi-Unit Housing Provincial Policy Manual with site standards has also been released to help local governments work with homebuilders to move forward with viable housing projects. Municipalities are required by legislation to consider this manual when developing local zoning bylaws and policies.   Bill 47 – Housing Statutes (Transit-Oriented Areas) Amendment Act:In some cases, higher-density neighbourhoods have been established around transit hubs, but in other cases, restrictive zoning bylaws and parking requirements, along with delayed development approvals, continue to slow down the delivery of homes and services near transit hubs.Through regulations, transit-oriented development (TOD) areas have now been defined. The regulations will prescribe 104 TOD Areas in 31 municipalities throughout B.C. within the first year of the legislation coming into effect. A full list of these municipalities is available in Backgrounder 2.The Provincial Policy Guidance Manual: Transit-Oriented Areas is a resource created to support local governments with the implementation of provincial Transit Oriented Area (TOA) requirements. The manual defines transit-oriented areas, prescribes minimum allowable densities and restricts local governments’ ability to mandate residential parking. Municipalities are required by legislation to consider this manual when developing bylaws for TOAs. Further details of regulations for all three pieces of legislation, including links to policy manuals and regulations, are included in the backgrounder at the end of this release.Modelling scenarios:In addition, the Province has released detailed modelling scenarios for the implementation of Bill 44 and 47. The Ministry of Housing retained a group of leading economic and planning experts to analyze what impacts the new frameworks for more small-scale, multi-unit homes (SSMUH) and designated transit-oriented development areas could have in B.C.The analysis used relevant international examples of recent zoning changes, particularly in New Zealand and Washington state, and examples from B.C., such as Kelowna. It’s important to note that modelling of future scenarios cannot account for unforeseen circumstances, the changing nature of housing, real estate markets and other factors.The findings from the analysis anticipates small-scale, multi-unit and transit-oriented development legislation could lead to between 216,000 and 293,000 additional net-new housing units for British Columbians over the next 10 years.The full report is now available to be accessed in Backgrounder 1.The legislation and the accompanying regulations and guides are part of the Province’s Homes for People action plan. Announced in spring 2023, the plan builds on historic action to deliver housing since 2017 and sets out further actions to deliver the homes people need faster, while creating more vibrant communities throughout B.C.Timelines:\n\tReleased today:\n\t\tregulations for Bill 35, 44, 47 deposited;\n\t\tProvince designates interim TOD Areas and policy manual released; and\n\t\tsmall-scale, multi-unit housing policy manual provided to local governments.\n\t\n\n\tJanuary 2024:\n\t\t$51 million distributed to local governments to help meet new requirements that promote the Province’s housing-density initiatives.  \n\t\n\n\tEarly 2024:\n\t\tHousing Needs Report guidance provided to local governments.\n\t\n\n\tFeb. 29, 2024:\n\t\tlocal governments’ request must be submitted to opt out of the principal-residence requirement.\n\t\n\n\tMay 1, 2024:\n\t\tprincipal-residence requirement (including definition of exempt areas or accommodations), changes to legal non-conforming use protections; and\n\t\tshort-term rental hosts will be required to display a valid business licence number on their listing, where a business licence is required by a local government.\n\t\n\n\tJune/July 2024:\n\t\tguidance provided to municipalities to update Official Community Plans and zoning bylaws.\n\t\t \n\t\n\tJune 30, 2024:\n\t\tlocal governments must have designated TOD Areas bylaw and removed minimum residential-parking requirements; and\n\t\tlocal governments must have updated their zoning bylaw to accommodate small-scale, multi-unit housing requirements (except in areas where they have applied for an extension).\n\t\n\n\tJan. 1, 2025:\n\t\tlocal governments must have completed their interim Housing Needs Report.\n\t\n\n\tDec. 31, 2025:\n\t\tmunicipalities update of their Official Community Plans and zoning bylaws (based on the interim Housing Needs Report).\n\t\nQuotes: Jens von Bergmann, Mountain Math –  “The SSMUH and TOA policies enable more housing options across the province, especially in centrally located areas with good transit access. We estimate that these initiatives will produce around 250,000 net-new homes over the next 10 years, helping British Columbians to form households more freely and live in communities of their choice, reducing rents and prices significantly below what they would have been in the absence of these reforms. The legislation serves to boost supply elasticity and help bring the price of housing back in line with the cost to build it.”Jake Fry, founder and principal, Smallworks – “The new standards create a pathway to ground-oriented, family-sized homes, complete with access to green space. This is the type of bold leadership we need to enable truly attainable housing for British Columbians.”Mike P. Moffatt, PLACE Centre Smart Prosperity Institute –“British Columbia’s reforms to allow for more homes near transit provides a model for other provinces to emulate. It will allow families to live closer to where they work, play and shop, and significantly reduce emissions from transportation. Hundreds of thousands of homes will now exist, thanks to this suite of policies.”Leo Spalteholz, advocate, Homes for Living – “Of the suite of reforms passed this fall, removing barriers to transit-oriented development has the potential to deliver the most new housing in the shortest timeframe in B.C.  In a time of rising construction costs, de-risking approvals and reducing costs for housing is crucial to address the shortage of homes.”Peter Waldkirch, director, Abundant Housing Vancouver –  “For too long, renters and people living in apartments have been confined to a minority of Vancouver's land. Even in the face of a severe housing shortage, apartments are banned close to some Skytrain stations. Abundant Housing Vancouver welcomes these steps towards legalizing housing near transit, along with others that will open up more areas to increased housing choice and new neighbours.”Julius Bloomfield, mayor of Penticton –“The housing crisis requires all levels of government to focus on creating more housing stock across the entire spectrum and the introduction of the regulations for short-term rentals brings clarity. Developers can either build vacation-accommodation only units that meet the regulations or they can construct long-term housing projects. Penticton continues to experience rapid growth and needs partners to help meet the economic, social and housing challenges ahead.”Jack Crompton, mayor, Resort Municipality of Whistler –“Housing for tourism workers really is the most important strategic priority for ensuring a strong and growing tourism economy for B.C. The enforcement tools the Province has made available through this legislation will allow Whistler to be more effective in our regulation of short-term rentals. This is good legislation.”Thorben Wieditz, executive director, Fairbnb Canada Network –“Fairbnb Canada Network would like to thank Housing Minister Kahlon for his leadership in establishing provincewide short-term rental regulations in B.C. The new regulatory measures will go a long way in helping local governments more effectively enforce short-term rental regulations and return much-needed housing stock to the long-term rental market. Establishing a provincial short-term rental registry, a provincewide principal residence requirement, platform accountability and data-sharing measures establish B.C. as a nationwide leader in protecting scarce housing stock from conversion into ghost-hotel inventory. We hope that more provinces will learn from B.C. and follow suit.”Learn More:To view a set of summary slides about the regulations and policy manuals, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/HousingGuidelines_Regs_SummarySlides_V2.pdf  To learn about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To view a map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C., visit: https://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/For more information about B.C. legislation, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/legislationFour backgrounders follow.Resources for Bill 35 – Short-Term Rental Accommodation Act:\nTo read the guidelines, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/STRPolicyGuidance2023.pdfResources for Bill 44 - Housing Statutes (Residential Development) Amendment Act and Bill 47- Housing Statutes (Transit-Oriented Development) Amendment Act: \nTo read the SSMUH and TOD Area policy manuals, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/local-governments-and-housing/housing-initiativesOther resources:\nTo read the full report on SSMUH and TOA scenarios in B.C., visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/bc_SSMUH_TOA_scenarios_Final.pdfTo view the regulations for all three Bills, visit: https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/The Short-Term Rental Accommodation Act establishes a provincial role in the regulation of short-term rentals.The legislation defines short-term rentals as rental listings that are being offered for stays of less than 90 consecutive days, and establishes a provincial principal-residence requirement in most communities.The legislation applies to all short-term rentals being offered to the public, including:\n\toffers hosted by a platform, where people reserve and pay for the rental service, like Airbnb, Expedia [VBRO and Homeaway] and Flipkey;\n\toffers on other web listing forums or sites established by property managers such as Facebook Marketplace, Kijiji or Craigslist; and\n\toffers in classified ads in newspapers.\nThe principal-residence requirement will apply in communities with a population more than 10,000, as well as some smaller neighbouring communities. A full list of communities where the primary-residence requirement will apply is available at: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/short-term-rentalsEffective May 1, 2024, in areas where the principal-residence requirement applies, short-term rentals will be limited to a host’s principal residence, and either a secondary suite or accessory dwelling unit (ADU) for most types of accommodation. Even if exempt from the principal-residence requirement, short-term rentals will be subject to provincial rules, including registration with the provincial registry, once the registry is in effect.Accommodation exemptions:The legislation does not apply to:\n\thotels, motels;\n\tvehicles such as recreational vehicles (RVs); and\n\ttents or temporary shelters.\nLand exempt from principal-residency requirement:\n\tStrata-titled hotel or motel if the owner may not use the property as a principal residence.\n\tProperties where owners hold a fractional interest and cannot use the property as their principal residence due to provisions in a fractional ownership agreement.\n\tTime Share properties.\n\tHome exchanges.\n\tLodges (accommodation provided by an operator of outdoor recreational activities such as hunting, fishing, water sports).\n\tStudent accommodation (owned or operated by the educational institution or by a non-profit organization).\n\tStrata-corporation guest suites intended for people visiting strata residents.\n\tRegional-district electoral areas (except University of British Columbia and the University Endowment Lands), with a choice to request to opt in by board resolution.\n\tMunicipalities with populations less than 10,000 and are not within 15 kilometres of a larger municipality (as specified in the regulation), with a choice to request to opt in by council resolution.\n\tFourteen resort municipalities, with the choice to request to opt in.\n\tForty-four mountain resorts/ski areas, comprising regional/destination resorts, BC Parks resorts, some private resorts and community ski resorts, with no provisions for opting in.*\n\tThe trust area (as defined in section 1 of the Island Trust Act), with a choice for local trust committees to request to opt in.*\n\tLand with BC Assessment farm class (Class 9), whether in the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR) or not*.\n*Note: Lands described in the final three bullets would remain exempt if the municipality or regional district surrounding them requested to opt in.Opting out of the principal-residence requirement:Municipalities with a population more than 10,000 in 2021 Census and a rental-vacancy rate of 3% or more for each of the two previous years can opt out of the principal-residence requirement. Municipalities with populations less than 10,000 in 2021, but that are within 15 kilometres of a municipality more than 10,000 that has a rental-vacancy rate that is 3% or more for each of the previous two years, can also opt out.Data for vacancy rates can be obtained through the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) report, which is published in late January of each year.For 2024, a local government’s request must be submitted to the Province by Feb. 29, 2024, to opt out of the principal-residence requirement before it comes into effect on May 1, 2024. In future, a local government’s request must be submitted to the Province by March 31st of each year, and the change will take effect on Nov. 1 of the same year.Opting into the principal-residence requirement:Municipalities with under 10,000 population, regional-district electoral areas and resort municipalities will be exempt from the principal-residence requirement, but may request to opt in. Mountain/ski resorts in rural areas are also exempt with no opt-in provision.Local governments requesting to opt in must submit written requests accompanied by resolutions. Requests should include appropriate background information that describes the area and jurisdiction. The request must be submitted to the minister of housing by March 31st of each year (starting in 2024) to take effect on Nov. 1 of the same year (starting in 2024) to give hosts notice to comply. Opting in remains in effect indefinitely unless a subsequent request to reverse the exemption is made by March 31st of a future year.Business licensing:As of May 1, 2024, short-term rental hosts will be required to display a valid business licence number on their listing, where a business licence is required by a local government. To enable local governments to validate the business licence number (if they wish to do so), platforms will be required to enable the posting of the business licence number.For short-term rentals, business licensing can provide valuable information about where these rentals are operating in the community.Regional districts now have broad business and licensing powers, parallel to those of municipalities, in accordance with Division 6.1 of the Local Government Act.Sharing data:Short-term rental platforms must record and maintain any short-term rental information provided to them and disclose that information to the minister of housing. This information may be shared with local governments. More information will be released in spring 2024.Fines and penalties:The new legislation increased the maximum penalties available to regional districts. The maximum penalty that a regional district may specify for bylaw offences prosecuted under the Offence Act has been increased to $50,000.The maximum fine that a local government and local trust committee of the Islands Trust may set for a bylaw ticket has been increased from $1,000 to $3,000 per infraction per day in accordance with the Community Charter Bylaw Enforcement Ticket Regulation and Vancouver Charter By-Law Enforcement Ticket Regulations.The Province is also introducing a short-term rental compliance and enforcement unit to support the implementation of the new legislation. The unit will act as a conduit between the platforms and local governments for data-sharing, facilitate the process for the removal of short-term rental listings that do not have valid local government business licences from platforms, and undertake enforcement actions related to the provincial short-term rentals regulatory regime.The policy manual is to be used by all local governments in B.C. to guide updates to zoning bylaws, other regulatory bylaws and policies undertaken to comply with small-scale multi-unit housing legislation. Subsequent resources or information bulletins may be issued by the Province to clarify or elaborate on changes to the requirements.Small-Scale Multi-Unit Housing (SSMUH) refers to a range of buildings and dwelling-unit configurations that can provide more affordable and attainable housing for middle-income families. Examples of SSMUH include, but are not limited to:\n\tsecondary suites in single-family dwellings or duplexes;\n\tdetached accessory-dwelling units (ADUs) like garden suites or laneway homes;\n\tduplexes (side-by-side or up/down);\n\ttriplexes and house-plexes; and\n\ttown homes.\nThe SSMUH legislation identifies where the prescribed number of housing units must be permitted by local governments on single-family and duplex lots with certain characteristics. Whether the prescribed number of housing units must be permitted on a given lot is determined by a variety of factors, including:\n\twhether or not the lot is within an urban containment boundary established by a regional growth strategy or an official community plan;\n\tlot size;\n\twhether a lot is serviced by municipal water and sewerage systems; and\n\tfor municipalities: population size, proximity of a given lot to transit services and the presence of specific heritage designations.\nLocal governments must amend their zoning and any related bylaws by June 30, 2024, to comply with this legislation and must consider the policy manual when doing so. In addition, local governments can no longer zone exclusively for single-family or duplex dwellings, except in areas that are exempt from this legislation.The SSMUH legislation also prohibits local governments from:\n\tRequiring off-street parking or loading spaces for the residential use of housing units in areas, where a minimum allowable density of six units is required in proximity to frequent bus transit.\n\tUsing density bonusing to achieve the minimum densities they are required to permit under SSMUH zoning, except that they may use density bonusing to achieve one of the six units required to be permitted near frequent bus transit.\n\tHolding a public hearing on a zoning bylaw or amendments to a zoning bylaw proposed, for the sole purpose of complying with the SSMUH legislation.\nExemptions:Lands in a local trust area under the Islands Trust Act and rural land-use bylaws under Section 457 of the Local government Act are exempt from the requirements.Local governments can also exempt land that is subject to hazardous conditions, where an increase in density would increase the risk from the hazardous conditions, the risk cannot practically be mitigated and a local government has a report from a qualified professional, like an engineer, attesting to the risk.Local governments can also exempt areas from the requirements for three to six units for the following reasons:\n\tland that is protected under s. 12.1 (2) of the Heritage Conservation Act;\n\tland that is designated as protected under a bylaw made under LGA, s. 611 [heritage designation protection] at the time the legislation comes into force;\n\tlands subject to a heritage revitalization agreement at the time the legislation comes into force;\n\tland that is not connected to a water or sewer system (parcels must be connected to both) provided as a service by a municipality or regional district;\n\tland that is within a zone in respect of which the minimum lot size that may be created by subdivision is 4,050 m2;\n\ta parcel of land that is larger than 4,050 m2; and\n\tland that is within a prescribed Transit Oriented Area.\nThe minister of housing may grant extensions to local governments to update their zoning bylaws if:\n\tthe local government is in the process of upgrading infrastructure that services the specific area or specific lot which the extension is being requested;\n\tthe infrastructure that services the area where SSMUH would apply is such that compliance by June 30, 2024, is likely to increase a risk to health, public safety or the environment in that area; or\n\textraordinary circumstances exist that otherwise prevent compliance in relation to the area (example would be major wildfire or flood events).\nA policy bulletin with detailed application criteria and information on requesting an exemption will be made available in January 2024.Local governments that do not comply with the legislative requirements for SSMUH by the compliance deadline of June 30, 2024, may be subject to a ministerial order that overrides their zoning bylaw and permits the minimum density of use required under SSMUH, until such a time as the local government undertakes updates to come into compliance with the legislation[JB1] [KAH2] . Local governments must update the official community plan by Dec. 31, 2025.Site standards:To comply with the SSMUH legislation, local governments will need to update their zoning bylaws by June 30, 2024, unless an extension is granted by the minister of housing.To support local governments with this process, a series of site standards has been prepared that provide technical specifications commonly found in zoning bylaws. These site standards set provincial expectations for how local governments enable financially viable SSMUH developments by providing flexibility for builders and developers.Four site standards have been prepared based on the different SSMUH unit requirements set out in the legislation. For specific information about each site standards, review the Small-Scale Multi-Unit Housing Provincial Policy Manual Site Standards.The Provincial Policy Guidance Manual is a resource to support local governments with the implementation of Provincial Transit-Oriented Areas (TOA) requirements.The legislation requires local governments to consider this policy manual when doing the following within a TOA:\n\tdesignating TOAs by bylaws;\n\tadopting/amending zoning bylaws;\n\tadopting/amending OCP bylaws (development plans for Vancouver);\n\tadopting/amending parking regulations bylaw.\nAdditional guidance materials may be issued from time to time by the Province to assist local governments with implementing the TOA legislative requirements.Within those TOAs, local governments are required to adhere to minimum densities when amending a zoning bylaw or updating an Official Community Plan (OCP) or Official Development Plan (ODP).The regulations contain the prescribed TOA transit stations, some of which take effect immediately and others which take effect in June 2024. The regulations also establish a minimum density (MD) that must be allowed in TOAs. The MD will depend on the nature of the transit station (bus vs. rail) and the distance from the transit station.\n\n\tSky Train station TOAs include SkyTrain and subway stops and all include a catchment area of 800 metres measured as a radium from the centre of each station. SkyTrain TOAs encompass a gross land area of 200 hectares (ha) and are comprised of three distinct tiers:\n\t\n\t\tTier 1 encompasses a gross land area of 12.5 ha within 200 metres or less from the station.\n\t\tTier 2 encompasses a gross land area of 37.5 ha within 201-400 metres from the station.\n\t\tTier 3 encompasses a gross land area of 150 ha with 401- 800 metres from the station.\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\n\tBus Exchanges and West Coast Express Stations are TOA nodes that have a catchment area of 400 metres. They encompass a gross land area of 50 ha and are comprised of two distinct tiers.\n\t\n\t\tTier 4 encompasses a gross land are of 12.5 ha within 200 metres or less from the exchange.\n\t\tTier 5 encompasses a gross land area of 37.5 ha within 201-400 metres from the exchange.\n\t\n\t\n\n\nAll West Coast Express stops are considered TOAs. Bus-exchange locations were identified based on multiple service and infrastructure criteria, including:\n\n\t15-minutes service frequency (between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.);\n\ttwo or more unique line connections;\n\tservice 7 days a week (between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.);\n\tone route meeting minimum frequency at least 12 hours/day; and\n\tpermanent, purpose-built infrastructure.\nIf a bus stop or exchange does not meet this criteria, it is not considered a TOA.The Province developed the Minimum Allowable Density Framework (MD Framework), that sets out densities which local governments must allow when considering zoning bylaw or Official Community Plan (OCP) amendments.The MD Framework relies on two metrics to define minimum allowable density:\n\n\tdensity measured by Floor Area Ratio (FAR), and\n\tbuilding height measured in storeys.\n\n\nThe MD Framework does not change the existing rezoning process of a local government. Application fees, submission requirements, staff reporting, bylaw introduction and readings, public hearings and final adoption continue as before. Only density and height requirement are imposed by the new framework*.\nBill 47 restricts local government ability to require residential off-street parking in TOAs, except for parking for people with disabilities and to access services and amenities.\nUnder these guidelines and legislation 47, local governments must amend their Official Community Plans (OCP) to include TOA designations by June 30, 2024. If OCPs are amended to include corresponding densities outlined by the MD Framework and the Province requires all zoning bylaws to comply with OCPs by July 31, 2024, the MD Framework may only be in force for less than a year for some locations.\nThe regulations create four categories that municipalities fit into based on type of stop, size of municipality and transit-service provided.\nA summary of these categories is available here: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/HousingGuidelines_Regs_SummarySlides_V2.pdf  \nThe identified 31 municipalities that must designate TOAs and adopt the minimum allowable densities prescribed in the regulations are as follows:\n\n\tCity of Abbotsford\n\tCity of Burnaby \n\tCity of Chilliwack \n\tCity of Colwood\n\tCity of Coquitlam\n\tCity of Delta\n\tCity of Kamloops \n\tCity of Kelowna\n\tCity of Langford\n\tCity of Langley\n\tTownship of Langley\n\tDistrict of Lantzville\n\tCity of Maple Ridge \n\tCity of Mission\n\tCity of Nanaimo\n\tCity of New Westminster\n\tCity of North Vancouver\n\tDistrict of North Vancouver\n\tCity of Penticton\n\tCity of Pitt Meadows\n\tCity of Prince George\n\tCity of Port Coquitlam\n\tCity of Port Moody\n\tCity of Richmond\n\tDistrict of Saanich\n\tCity of Surrey\n\tCity of Vancouver\n\tCity of Vernon\n\tTown of View Royal\n\tCity of Victoria\n\tResort Municipality of Whistler\nThe guidance also includes a step-by-step guide for local government to appropriately designate all TOAs within their jurisdiction and implement the MD Framework.Local governments must pass a bylaw that designates each TOA in accordance with the LGA, including a map, plan or other graphic material by June 30, 2024, and notify the minister of housing in writing of the final adoption of the bylaw that is compliant with TOA requirements, including a copy of the bylaw.*Any rezoning application that has received First Reading by its respective local government before Jan. 1, 2024, will be exempt from the requirements of TOA Legislation 47 and Regulation 44.",

    "title": "Homes opening for seniors, people living with disabilities in Comox",
    "resolutionId": null,
    "meetingType": "Ministry of Housing",
    "contents": "COMOX – Seniors and people living with disabilities in Comox are moving into 52 new affordable and accessible rental homes with the opening of Cypress Gardens.“The north Island is not immune to the housing crisis and Cypress Gardens will give seniors and people who need accessible housing in the Comox Valley a safe and affordable place to live and age in place,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “Our government shares the community’s excitement in seeing the building open and will continue to work with our partners to support the housing needs for seniors and people living with disabilities throughout B.C.”Located at 1582 Balmoral Ave., the new three-storey wood-frame building is owned and operated by the Comox Valley Affordable Housing Society (CVAHS). The 52 one-bedroom units are for seniors 60 and older, and people of all ages living with disabilities. The building replaces a 16-unit townhouse complex owned by CVAHS, which was reaching the end of its lifespan, and more than triples the number of affordable housing units on the site and enhances the neighbourhood.“We are taking action to make sure people can stay in the communities where they have connections and feel safe and comfortable,” said Ronna-Rae Leonard, MLA for Courtenay-Comox. “Thank you to the Comox Valley Affordable Housing Society for their work to improve the quality of life for seniors and people living with disabilities. I look forward to seeing the difference these new innovative homes will make in our community for years to come.”Cypress Gardens was carefully designed to meet the needs of people with various disabilities that might affect mobility, vision and hearing. Twelve of the units are wheelchair accessible. The remaining units are adaptable, meaning they have been designed to easily accommodate future renovations to improve accessibility if the tenant’s needs change. The building has earned a certified gold rating under the Rick Hansen Foundation Accessibility Certification (RHFAC) program.“This building shows that with a bit of pre-planning, affordable housing can be made accessible to everyone,” said Ann Janssen, executive director, CVAHS. “By making housing accessible, we can enable people to thrive, making a difference in the lives of those with disabilities and seniors who wish to age in place.”The building features a large community room, an on-site office and a laundry facility on each floor. It is located close to downtown Comox, providing easy access to nearby shopping, medical care and recreational facilities.“Congratulations to the Comox Valley Affordable Housing Society for their RHF Accessibility Certified Gold achievement at Cypress Gardens,” said Brad McCannell, vice-president of Access and Inclusion, Rick Hansen Foundation. “This project demonstrates the kind of leadership needed to ensure our communities can accommodate people of all ages, incomes and abilities. An RHFAC gold environment delivers the aging-in-place solutions needed to support residents now and in the future.”Rent for half the units will be geared to income, where rent is 30% of the tenant’s income. Some of the units will be rented to households with very low incomes, such as those receiving income or disability assistance, or a basic senior’s pension. Others will be rented at affordable market rates, ranging from $1,400 to $1,450 per month.“We are delighted about the opening of Cypress Gardens,” said Nicole Minions, mayor of Comox. “We know the residents were eagerly anticipating completion and we warmly welcome them into their new homes. Its design, considerate of diverse abilities, proudly fosters an inclusive living space in our community.”This project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes delivered or underway, including more than 800 in the Comox Valley.Quick Facts:\n\tThe Province, through BC Housing, provided approximately $5.2 million to the project through the Building BC: Community Housing Fund and will provide approximately $161,000 in annual operating funding.\n\tCVAHS provided $1.84 million in equity as well as the land, which was valued at $890,000 at the time of purchase.\n\nLearn More:To learn more about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing",

    "resolutionId": null,
    "meetingType": "Ministry of Housing",
    "contents": "VICTORIA – New regulations will make it easier for people living in strata developments to request electric-vehicle (EV) charging stations where they live.“Lack of access to electric-vehicle charging should not be a deterrent to people wanting to purchase or rent in a strata complex, which for some is a more affordable housing option,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister for Housing. “We’re ensuring that people living in strata developments have a process to request access to electric-vehicle charging, while also helping stratas to plan for and manage electrical capacity. We’re considering future need, adapting to climate change and building a low-carbon B.C.” The regulations outline a process for a homeowner in a strata to request to install an EV charging station and determine a timeline for strata corporations to respond. The regulations also enable strata corporations to grant permission to an owner to exclusively use a parking stall on common property on land that is a common asset for as long as five years if EV charging has been installed and the installation resulted from an owner’s request for EV charging.“British Columbians are choosing electric vehicles at record rates. In November, we passed legislative amendments to accelerate zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) targets and get more electric vehicles in B.C.,” said Josie Osborne, Minister of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation. “This regulation under the Strata Property Act helps make it easier for people who live in strata properties to go electric with a clearer pathway to accessing and installing EV charging stations right where they live.”Strata corporations will also be required to obtain an Electrical Planning Report (EPR), which will help stratas plan for future upgrades and demands on their electrical systems, such as conversion to heat pumps and installation of cooling equipment, and support resident requests for EV charging. Small stratas of fewer than five units will be exempt from the EPR requirement.“The upcoming regulations under the Strata Property Act provide a balanced solution to owners who want to purchase electric vehicles and require charging facilities,” said Tony Gioventu, CEO of Condominium Home Owners Association. “The EPR will allow strata corporations to plan for costs and operations associated with electric demand.”The EPR must include a range of information, including the current building electrical capacity, peak demand, spare capacity, future anticipated electricity demand, a list of systems powered by electricity (including EV charging stations), and recommendations about how to manage electrical capacity and demand. More information about the EPR requirements will be available online.The deadline for stratas to obtain an EPR will be phased in over several years. Stratas located in Metro Vancouver Regional District, Fraser Valley Regional District and the Capital Regional District (excluding the Gulf Islands) will be required to obtain an EPR by late 2026. Stratas located in other areas of the province will be required to obtain an EPR by late 2028.“Electric vehicles are a great option for British Columbians looking to reduce their impact on the environment, because 98% of the electricity BC Hydro generates comes from clean and renewable resources,” said Chris O’Riley, president and CEO of BC Hydro. “These new regulations will support EV adoption for people living in stratas and allow more British Columbians to charge their EVs at home.”These regulations also bring into force the remainder of Bill 22, the Strata Property Amendment Act introduced in spring 2023, which lowered the voting threshold from three-quarters approval to majority for approval of certain decisions related to the installation of electric-vehicle charging equipment.  The Strata Property Regulations support the Province’s CleanBC Roadmap to 2030 and its commitment to ensure that all new space- and water-heating equipment sold and installed in B.C. will be 100% efficient after 2035.  These regulations are effective as of Dec. 6, 2023.Learn More:To learn about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn more about the changes to electric-vehicle charging in strata corporations, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/strata-housing/operating-a-strata/the-environment/electric-vehicle-chargingTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/To learn about B.C.’s Go Electric EV charger rebate program and the full suite of Go Electric programming, visit: https://goelectricbc.gov.bc.caTo learn about B.C.'s Zero-Emission Vehicles Act, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/zeroemissionvehiclesFor more information about B.C. legislation, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/legislation",

    "resolutionId": null,
    "meetingType": "Ministry of HousingMinistry of Housing",
    "contents": "VICTORIA – The Province adopted the British Columbia Building and Fire Codes (BC Codes 2024) to provide people with a greater level of building safety and to make new buildings more sustainable, resilient and accessible.“As we take historic steps to build more homes for people faster, we are also taking action to make sure homes are safe, accessible and more resilient to climate change,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “We have to find ways to innovate and build differently. Over the next year, the Province will lead a discussion on enabling single-egress stairs in the BC Building Code.”Key updates to the building code will require all new buildings to:\n\tprovide one living space that is designed not to exceed 26 C;\n\thave power-operated doors in all building entrances and universal washrooms; and\n\thave an elevator in all large two- and three-storey apartment buildings.\nAdditional updates to the building code focus on accessibility, mass-timber construction and radon safety.“We have seen evidence of extreme weather impacting our province and warmer temperatures because of climate change,” said Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer. “We need to find ways to protect people in B.C., especially those most at risk from being impacted by extreme heat, to have the supports they need to be safe. These adjustments to the BC Building Code are one measure that will help to ensure people in shared spaces have somewhere they can go to on hot days to stay cool and be better protected from hot weather. We know that heat can sneak up on us, so we want people to be as prepared as they can to find cool places when temperatures rise.”Most updates to the building code will come into effect provincewide on March 8, 2024. The implementation window will allow construction and housing-industry professionals more time to review the changes and complete any necessary training. It will also allow an easier transition for housing projects underway.The updates align with the new Residential Development Act, which includes small-scale, multi-unit housing (SSMUH) legislation that will allow three to four units on land currently zoned for single-family homes and duplexes, and as many as six units near bus stops with frequent transit service.The Province is deferring the effective date on the adaptable dwellings and earthquake-design changes to March 10, 2025, to provide a one-year transition period. This will allow the Ministry of Housing to work with interested parties and local governments to develop strategies to implement the new requirements.“Eliminating barriers to accessibility is a core motive in our efforts to making our province a safe and barrier-free place to live in,” said Susie Chant, Parliamentary Secretary for Accessibility. “We are taking action on what we’ve heard in our engagements with British Columbians, especially people living with disabilities. That is why we are updating the standards in our building code to support everyone in their day-to-day activities.”As the Province updates the building code, it continues to work to identify and review opportunities to support cost-effective and efficient construction of more new homes. The Province, along with fire-safety professionals and national partners, is examining opportunities in codes, including requirements for egress stairs. These opportunities may simplify the design of smaller multi-unit residential buildings and create options for quicker and more affordable construction, while maintaining or enhancing safety.The BC Building Code is a provincial regulation that governs how a building’s construction, alterations and demolitions are required to be carried out. The code establishes minimum requirements for safety, health, accessibility, fire and structural protection of buildings, and energy and water efficiency.Quotes:Brad McCannell, vice-president of access and inclusion, Rick Hansen Foundation –“The Rick Hansen Foundation is pleased to have contributed input into the proposed changes to the BC Building Code. The updates are welcomed by people with varying disabilities and we applaud the Government of B.C.’s continued commitment towards improved meaningful accessibility for people of all ages and abilities.”Larry Clay, chairperson, SAFERhome Standards Society –“What we build today defines our tomorrow. A tomorrow where everyone, regardless of their age, size, ability or mobility, can enjoy their home. The Province of B.C. stands as an exemplar of innovation, inclusivity and foresight, showcasing the kind of progress imperative for addressing today's evolving housing needs. There is much work ahead and we eagerly anticipate collaborating with the Province of B.C., municipalities and builders, ensuring proper training and implementation to make universal housing a reality for all.”Anne McMullin, president and CEO, Urban Development Institute (UDI) –“UDI and members of the building industry have actively engaged with the Ministry of Housing over the last year on these changes and we are pleased that the ministry is taking additional time to ensure the seismic and accessibility provisions can be implemented in a cost-effective and efficient way. We look forward to continuing to work with the ministry on opportunities to deliver homes and job spaces quicker and more affordably.”Helaine Boyd, executive director, Disability Alliance BC –“Disability Alliance BC (DABC) is looking forward to witnessing how these BC Building Code changes will directly impact the lives of people with disabilities in need of accessible housing. We hope that the BC Building Code changes will continue conversations and ultimately contribute to greater social and economic inclusion for people with disabilities in our province.”Quick Facts: \n\tThe changes include updates to Plumbing Systems Book II and adoption of the National Fire Code 2020 as the BC Fire Code.\n\tThe BC Building Code applies across the province, except on some federal lands and in the City of Vancouver, which has its own building bylaw.\n\tAdoption of the new BC Codes follows an 11-week public engagement on accessibility from October 2021 until January 2022, and a four-week public review in spring 2023, which invited interested parties to review and comment on a variety of proposed building-code changes. A second engagement happened in October 2023 to explore the impact of earthquake-design changes.\n\tThe four-week technical review in spring 2023 resulted in 251 responses, the majority of which indicated that the proposals were clear and buildable.\nLearn More: To learn about the new BC Codes, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/construction-industry/building-codes-standards/bc-codes  To read the summary report on feedback received during early engagement on accessibility, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/construction-industry/building-codes-standards/resources-contactinformation  To learn about the Province’s work to digitize the BC Building Code, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000496A backgrounder follows.The Province is adopting changes to the BC Building Code (BC Code), a provincial regulation that governs how buildings in B.C. get built. Most code changes will come into effect on March 8, 2024, except for adaptable dwellings and earthquake-design changes which will come into effect on March 10, 2025.A summary of the changes to new residential buildings:Accessibility:\n\tPower-operated doors in all building entrances and universal washrooms.\n\tAn elevator in all large two- and three-storey apartment buildings.\n\tDesignated wheelchair spaces in event facilities.\n\tMore inclusive signage to increase wayfinding and building safety.\n\tFull-size change tables in universal washrooms.\n\tAssisted-listening systems for people with hearing loss.\nCooling requirements:\n\tAll new residential buildings must provide one living space that is designed not to exceed 26 C. This may require a cooling appliance in many parts of the province, depending on weather and site conditions.\nMass-timber construction:\n\tThe Province has permitted the use of mass-timber buildings, in harmonization with the National Building Code 2020, across B.C.\nRadon safety:\n\tProvincewide adoption of a rough-in for a radon-extraction system.\nThe Province is deferring the effective date on adaptable dwellings and earthquake-design changes to March 10, 2025, to provide a one-year transition period.Adaptable dwellings:Adaptable dwellings are designed and built with features that can be changed to meet occupants’ needs, allowing them to stay in their homes through illness, injury, and/or aging.\n\tAll residential suites in large residential buildings and ground-floor suites in small apartment buildings will have:\n\t\taccessible clearances through doorways and along paths of travel to living spaces;\n\t\tmanoeuvring space in a bedroom, bathroom and kitchen;\n\t\tswitches and other controls at an accessible height; and\n\t\treinforcement of bathroom walls to allow future installation of grab bars.\n\t\n\tModest increases for smaller residential housing, such as single-detached homes, townhomes and row homes, will require:\n\t\treinforcement of bathroom walls to allow future installation of grab bars.\n\t\nEarthquake design:\n\tNew methodologies for earthquake design for small buildings, in harmonization with the National Building Code.\n\tThese changes respond to increased earthquake risks and new national standards to protect new buildings and life safety.",

This is one of the ways we are moving forward on reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples in B.C.”The IHF provides approximately $1.8 billion to build 3,500 new homes for Indigenous families, individuals and elders, on and off reserve. To date, more than 1,500 IHF homes are open or underway throughout B.C. BC Housing will accept proposals for the IHF until April 30, 2024, to ensure adequate time for applicants to prepare submissions. The proposals will be evaluated and projects totalling approximately 1,200 units are expected to be announced by summer 2024. Projects will be prioritized based on several criteria, including residential and regional housing needs.“The Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs (UBCIC) welcomes and fully appreciates the announcement from the Province that new affordable homes will soon be available for First Nations,” said Grand Chief Stewart Philip, UBCIC. “There remains much work to do and the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs is committed to working with the Ministry of Housing, as they carry out their Declaration Act Action Plan commitments in ensuring that all First Nations have a safe and affordable place to call home.”Indigenous non-profit housing providers, First Nations, other Indigenous organizations, and non-profit and for-profit developers wanting to partner with Indigenous organizations and First Nations interested in creating new affordable rental units for Indigenous people are encouraged to submit their housing proposals and apply for funding.To assist with housing proposals, a new application form and process is available for non-profit societies, housing co-ops, municipal housing providers, First Nations and Indigenous governments to apply for early access to project-development funding. This funding is for organizations that need additional financial or operational support to advance their affordable housing project such as hiring an architect or design consultant to create a more fully formed and competitive proposal.The IHF is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway.Quick Facts:\n\tThis is the second request for proposals (RFP) for the Indigenous Housing Fund.

    "contents": "VANCOUVER – More affordable housing for women and families in Vancouver is on the way as construction starts on 135 new homes.“We know the housing crisis is making it extremely difficult for women and single mothers to find an affordable place to call home,” said Ravi Kahlon, B.C.’s Minister of Housing. “These 135 much-needed rental homes will make a huge difference in the lives of the women and families who move in, giving them a fresh start and a strong foundation for success. We’re proud to be working in partnerships to build homes like these to make sure everyone in this province, especially women who need financial stability, can access homes they can afford.”The project is a partnership between the Province, through BC Housing, the federal government, through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, Soroptimist International of Vancouver, the City of Vancouver and Purpose Driven Development.The redevelopment at 550 West 13th Ave. will replace an aging 21-unit building with a 13-storey, 135-unit tower, for a net increase of 114 new affordable homes. It will have a mix of studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments to support families of different sizes.The building will be owned and operated by Soroptomist International of Vancouver, an organization focused on women that supports women with low incomes achieving financial independence and housing security. The society also operated the previous building on this site and will offer all previous tenants the opportunity to move into these new homes.“We’re focused on improving the lives of women by providing access to education and training to achieve economic empowerment,” said Carla Busnardo, board member, Soroptimist International of Vancouver. “Our innovative project empowers women through holding a lease in their name and supports families to achieve financial independence. Vancouver Soroptimists are helping women be their best by providing affordable housing.”Residents will have access to a range of amenities, including indoor and outdoor gathering spaces, a rooftop patio and shared working spaces, along with flexible space for educational classes, activities and events to support a positive community. Construction is expected to be complete in 2026.“Affordable housing projects like this for women and children are long overdue and welcome news in Vancouver,” said George Heyman, MLA for Vancouver-Fairview. “Everyone deserves access to affordable, stable housing, and this project is the latest step in our work to provide homes for people and families on fixed incomes. We know there is more to do and we’re going to keep working with our partners to deliver thousands of homes here and across the province.”These homes are part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes delivered or underway, including nearly 8,000 in Vancouver.Quotes: Sean Fraser, federal Minister of Housing, Infrastructure and Communities –  “Today, we can see the positive impact of the National Housing Strategy, with 135 new homes designed by, for and with women in Vancouver. These homes are not just bricks and mortar, but a symbol of hope and empowerment for women who need a safe and affordable place to call home. This project is creating a community where women can thrive and support each other, while starting new chapters in their lives, and that is something we can all be proud of.”  Taleeb Noormohamed, MP for Vancouver-Granville – “Access to secure housing has a profound impact on an individual’s well-being, their ability to pursue opportunities, and their connection to the community. I am proud that all levels of government are coming together to provide new affordable homes for women here in Vancouver. Together, we build a stronger and more vibrant community where everyone has a place to call home.” Ken Sim, mayor of Vancouver – “Secure housing provides individuals and families with a stable foundation and fosters strong, connected communities. This is such an important project, when we invest in women and girls, we are investing in our own future. By fostering an atmosphere where women and girls can thrive, we lay the groundwork for a more equitable and resilient Vancouver.”Carla Guerrera, CEO and founder, Purpose Driven Development –“We’re proud to be the development lead for this remarkable project working to close the glaring gap in the housing needs of women by providing affordable housing delivered by women for women.

Through the new laws we passed, we're making sure homes are built faster and that homes are used for people, not speculators or investors.”   The B.C. legislature passed 19 pieces of legislation in the fall session, with two additional bills expected to be passed on Nov. 30, 2023, including strong and comprehensive action on housing to turn short-term rentals into homes for people, fix outdated zoning laws, create more small-scale, multi-unit homes and speed up the delivery of homes, including near transit hubs.​ New laws on climate action and emergency response, protection for workers, credential recognition, and to keep people safe and communities strong were also at the top of the legislative agenda.“Housing is one of the biggest challenges facing people in B.C. The housing crisis is hurting people and holding back our province’s economic potential,” said Ravi Kahlon, Government House Leader and Minister of Housing. “That’s why this fall, we introduced a thoughtful and complete package of legislation designed to deliver more homes within reach for people and families, and to crack down on speculators and profiteers in the housing market, while also tackling other challenges that matter most to people.”Key pieces of housing legislation passed in the fall session include:\n\treining in the rapidly expanding short-term rental market and turning short-term rentals into homes for people through the Short-Term Rentals Accommodations Act;\n\n\tdelivering more small-scale, multi-unit housing for people, including townhomes, triplexes and laneway homes, and fix outdated zoning rules to help build more homes faster through Bill 44;\n\n\tspeeding up the delivery of homes, removing barriers and encouraging more communities near transit, services and amenities that make life better for people through new transit-oriented development legislation. This legislation if passed builds on work underway to facilitate more transit-oriented development and create more livable communities; and\n\n\treducing construction delays and streamlining processes to fund key services, infrastructure and amenities for growing communities through new development finance tools in Bill 46.\nOther significant pieces of legislation passed includes implementing a more proactive approach to emergency management, with an emphasis on disaster-risk reduction, introducing systemic change to improve outcomes for Indigenous learners, accelerating zero-emission vehicles targets, better protecting B.C.’s forests and ecosystems, improving working conditions for online platform workers and providing more support for victims of violent crime.“This fall, we took big steps forward to deliver more homes for people faster and we’re already starting to see a positive impact,” Kahlon said. “Make no mistake, this isn’t easy or simple, but we’re going to keep doing the work, finding solutions to address the biggest challenges, so people can build a good life here.”The Province also expanded the successful speculation and vacancy tax to 13 additional communities to fight real estate speculation and turn more empty units into homes. Detailed regulations and guideline manuals to help municipalities and home builders implement the new housing zoning rules will be released in the coming weeks.The Ministry of Housing is developing legislative tools, which will be brought forward in spring 2024, to support local government in developing inclusionary zoning policies to create more affordable housing. In early 2024, the ministry in partnership will also launch BC Builds, a new program that will leverage public and low-cost land, faster development timelines and low-interest construction financing and grants, to increase the amount of rental housing that is affordable for people and families with middle incomes.Learn More:To learn about legislation passed in the fall session, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/legislationTo read Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Homes_For_People.pdfTo view Homes for People technical briefing presentation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Homes4People.pdfTo view a map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C., visit: https://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCA backgrounder follows.The government passed 19 pieces of legislation in the fall session, with two additional bills expected to be passed on Nov. 30, 2023, focused on tackling the biggest challenges people in B.C. are facing.Highlights of the legislation:Turning short-term rentals into homes for people:\n\tThe Short-Term Rental Accommodations Act is helping to turn short-term rentals into long-term homes for people by changing how and where short-term rentals are allowed in B.C.\nHousing near transit hubs:\n\tNew proposed legislation aims to speed up delivery of homes and encourage more communities near transit, services and amenities that make life better for people.\nDelivering more small-scale, multi-unit homes for families with middle incomes:\n\tThe Province is introducing new housing legislation to deliver more small-scale, multi-unit housing for people, including townhomes, triplexes and laneway homes, and fix outdated zoning rules to help build more homes faster.\nStreamlining the construction of homes, services and infrastructure:\n\tAs part of work underway to deliver more homes for people faster, the Province has introduced new legislation to reduce construction delays and streamline processes to fund key services, infrastructure and amenities for growing communities.\nPaving the way for resilient communities:\n\tThe Emergency and Disaster Management Act will implement a more proactive approach to emergency management, with an emphasis on disaster-risk reduction, to keep people and communities safer.\nAddressing public drug use:\n\tThe Restricting Public Consumption of Illegal Substances Act will restrict public use of hard drugs like crystal methamphetamine, fentanyl and crack cocaine in designated public spaces.\nGiving newcomers a fair chance to work:\n\tThe International Credentials Recognition Act will require 18 regulatory bodies to remove unfair barriers, increase transparency and streamline the international credential recognition process for 29 professions.

I’m committed to working with the City of Kelowna and our non-profit partners to bring in more permanent supportive housing to address homelessness and the housing security challenges many are struggling with.”Located on city-owned land at 2740 Hwy. 97 N., a new modular housing development will include 60 temporary supportive homes. These new homes will be operated by an experienced non-profit organization that will provide support services, including daily meals, 24/7 staffing, access to skills training and support navigating the housing system. People moving into these homes will be assessed and matched with appropriate supports.The Province, through BC Housing, is providing a grant of approximately $3.9 million for the homes from the new Homeless Encampment Action Response Temporary Housing (HEARTH) program and will provide annual operating funding.“Every effort that helps people access safe and dignified housing options is a step in the right direction,” said Tom Dyas, mayor of Kelowna. “These rooms will reduce the number of people needing to shelter outside and allow people to connect more easily with health and wellness services. We are thankful the Province is taking meaningful action to address homelessness in our community through the HEART (Homeless Encampment Action Response Teams) and HEARTH program investments, which will help people transition from temporary to permanent housing.”Work on the site will begin in December with an expected opening date in early 2024. BC Housing and the city will provide opportunities for neighbours in the immediate area to learn more about the development.The modular housing development follows a recent announcement of a 60-unit tiny-home development at 759 Crowley Ave. Both projects are intended as temporary housing solutions, providing time for BC Housing to continue working with the city to identify and build new permanent supportive housing.The Province has more than 77,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway throughout the province, including more than 1,700 homes in Kelowna.Quick Facts:\n\tThe Province and the City of Kelowna recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that formalizes their commitment to work together to better support people who are unhoused, sheltering in encampments and to help prevent encampments in the future.\n\tThrough the MOU, the city commits to bring forward available land and expedite land-use decisions for new shelter and supportive-housing projects.\n\tIn addition to the HEARTH program, the Province and city are partnering to implement HEART, a new multidisciplinary regional program designed to rapidly respond to encampments to better help people sheltering outdoors move inside.\n\tThe HEART program brings together the provincial and local governments, Indigenous partners, health-care agencies and non-profit organizations to assess the needs of people sheltering in encampments and provide rapid access to the supports and services they need to find a home.\n\tBoth the HEART and HEARTH programs are part of Belonging in BC, the Province's plan to prevent and reduce homelessness.\n\tThe plan will also add 3,900 new supportive housing units, 240 complex-care housing units and 3,000 supported rent supplements provincewide.\nLearn More:To read the MOU, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/BC-MOU_Kelowna_HEART-HEARTH.pdfTo learn about the HEART and HEARTH programs, visit:https://www.bchousing.org/housing-assistance/homelessness-services/HEART-HEARTH",

    "contents": "VICTORIA – Homeowners and builders will soon be able to develop new housing quicker and with less cost as the Province works to create new standardized designs for small-scale, multi-unit homes, such as townhomes, triplexes and laneway homes.“In order to address our housing crisis, we must use innovative solutions to enable housing to be built faster,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “Having standardized building designs available can help streamline the permitting process. We will work to add additional designs in the coming years to ensure our communities remain vibrant and have a variety of housing options.”Through the new Standardized Housing Design Project, the Province is creating new standardized, customizable residential designs for small-scale, multi-unit housing built on single lots. These designs can be adopted by local governments and offered to builders and homeowners at a significantly below-market cost to expedite permitting and development. The Province is seeking to engage a consultant team to provide expert advice on the development of these designs.Standardized designs can substantially streamline the permitting process to make it easier for local governments to give building-permit approvals quickly and save builders and homeowners the costs that come from expensive design services. They also assist smaller local governments that may not have the resources to develop standardized designs to help approve developments efficiently and quickly.The move follows the recent introduction of legislation that, when passed, will allow three to four units on land currently zoned for single-family homes and duplexes, and as many as six units near bus stops with frequent transit service. During the consultation process, local governments suggested a catalogue of design options needs to be available to support small-scale developers, builders and homeowners to build these new homes.A request for proposals to select a consultant was issued Nov. 15, 2023, for the first phase of the project and will close Dec. 13, 2023. The consultant’s scope of work will include collaborative engagement with industry professionals and local governments to develop the design parameters that can be used to create standardized housing designs. The consultant will also support the Province in reviewing the draft and completed designs. The Province will work with the consultant for nine months, with the goal to procure design services by spring 2024. Standardized designs and plans are expected to be available to local governments by summer 2024.As many as 10 different designs will be developed. The designs will comply with the BC Building Code and are expected to be as close as possible to building-permit ready, recognizing minor amendments may be required by local designers or architects to take into account specific site conditions. The designs will be created for various lot sizes and configurations to be widely applicable throughout B.C. and are expected to help builders and homeowners add increased density to their existing properties quickly and more affordably.In addition to the housing designs, a separate project is underway to develop guidebooks that can act as a blueprint for local governments to implement a pre-approval process and provide guidance to homeowners and small-scale builders about how to add density to their lots with standardized designs.The Standardized Housing Design Project is in line with a key strategy of the Homes for People action plan to unlock more homes quicker by creating the conditions to encourage faster housing construction while also reducing development costs and approval delays. It also builds on actions such as the Housing Supply Act that allows the Province to set housing targets for municipalities with the greatest housing needs and greatest population growth.Quotes:Tom Dyas, mayor of Kelowna –“We applaud the Province’s initiative to provide standard designs for infill housing, as we have witnessed the benefits of this approach in Kelowna. We initiated a similar design competition in the past that facilitated the accelerated construction of fourplexes on former single-family lots. This helped to improve the attainability, quality and affordability of housing in our existing neighbourhoods, and also boosted the local economy by creating opportunities for local builders.”Mike Moffatt, founding director, PLACE Centre –“Making standardized designs available speeds up approval processes, accelerates the adoption of innovative new technologies and techniques and reduces construction costs. British Columbia is once again showing leadership in addressing the housing shortage and providing a model for other provinces to emulate.”Tamara White, executive director, Small Housing –“Small Housing’s research shows that standardized designs for laneway homes and multiplexes can reduce uncertainty and costs for builders by significantly simplifying permitting, saving builders and local governments time and money. They also can raise aesthetic and energy efficiency design standards and help community members imagine what new housing options can look like in their neighbourhoods. We commend the work of the Province in recognizing the crucial role that standardized home designs will play in making our communities not just more livable and vibrant, but in ensuring that housing becomes more attainable for the many and not just the few.\"Maura Gatensby, architect, lead practice adviser and regulatory liaison, Architectural Institute of B.C. –“Codes are advancing rapidly and it can be difficult for the construction industry to keep up with the changes. The provision of standard designs of code-compliant homes will assist in addressing affordability, while making high-quality designs of the latest high-performance standards more readily available.”Quick Facts: \n\tThis project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government.\n\tSince 2017, the Province has nearly 77,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway.\n\tIn a related move, the Province allocated as much as $91 million over three years for a pilot project encouraging homeowners to develop new secondary suites in 2024.\n\tThe BC Building Code is a provincial regulation that governs how a building’s construction, alterations and demolitions are required to be carried out.\nLearn More: For information about this request for proposals, visit: https://www.bcbid.gov.bc.ca/page.aspx/en/bpm/process_manage_extranet/183220For information about BC Building Codes and Standards, visit:\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/construction-industry/building-codes-standards/bc-codesTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/For information about B.C. legislation, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/legislationA backgrounder follows.The Province is launching its Standardized Housing Design project in two phases.First, the Province will engage a consultant team to provide expert advice on the development of standardized designs for small-scale, multi-unit dwellings and accessory dwelling units.Second, the Province will select a designer to create as many as 10 designs based on the design parameters determined by the consultant team.Key points related to the overall project:\n\tObjectives\n\t\tTo make it easier for local governments and faster for builders to construct small-scale multi-unit dwellings (SSMUDs) and accessory dwelling units (ADUs).\n\t\tTo lower the initial design costs and building costs for SSMUDs and ADUs for homeowners and small-scale builders.\n\t\tTo provide a catalogue of quality BC Building Code-compliant building designs.\n\t\tTo improve livability of unit layouts.\n\t\n\n\tPhase 1 – Consultant Output\n\t\tEffective stakeholder engagement with local governments and industry experts to determine the design parameters that take into account various site configurations and conditions, design layouts and unit sizes.\n\t\tSupport in drafting the designer procurement materials to ensure accurate guidelines in the request for proposals and provide ministry support in evaluating proposals received and in the selection of a qualified designer.\n\t\tProvide subject matter expertise in evaluating draft and completed designs delivered under the design contract with the selected designer.\n\t\n\n\tPhase 2 – Designer Output\n\t\tSSMUDs\n\t\t\tSix designs for multi-unit infill projects with as many as four units on a lot that are buildable and marketable with a focus on affordability.\n\t\t\tDesigns are to target urban and suburban lots where the greatest uptake would be expected.\n\t\t\tDesigns must account for varying lot configurations, such as laneway access, interior lots and corner lots.\n\t\t\n\t\tADUs\n\t\t\tFour distinct designs for detached accessory dwelling units.\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tTimeline\n\t\tProject launch: December 2023\n\t\tProcurement of designer: spring 2024\n\t\tFinal designs available to local governments: summer 2024",

Each unit contains as many as four bedrooms, a small kitchen, storage and a private bathroom.Kelowna Women’s Shelter operates the building with offices on site.“Providing safe housing for those fleeing domestic abuse is critical,” said Michelle Dickie, interim executive director, Kelowna Women’s Shelter. “We are relieved to be able to provide a much-needed second-stage program that includes safe housing for those looking to rebuild after abuse. It is important to continue to invest in supports for women to be able to take steps for safety and independence.”Transition houses are staffed around the clock and provide safe, short-term shelter and supports, typically for as long as 30 days. Second-stage housing provides safe short-term housing and supports for women after they leave an abusive relationship or situation. Women typically move into second-stage housing after a stay in a transition house and can stay in the units while they prepare for independent living.The Province, through BC Housing, provided approximately $16.2 million through the Building BC: Women’s Transition Housing Fund to the project and will provide an additional $1.9 million in annual operating funding.“We know how important it is for women to find comfort and support in their living arrangements after leaving intimate-partner violence,” said Kelli Paddon, Parliamentary Secretary for Gender Equity. “Having distance and security is the first step when people are rebuilding their life and we will continue to lift up women in our province by supporting safe spaces like these transition-housing initiatives.” The development is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has nearly 77,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway, including approximately 300 homes in West Kelowna.Quick Facts:\n\tAs is standard for projects for women and children leaving violence, the address of this project has not been disclosed for safety reasons.\n\tThe Women’s Transition Housing Fund was created in 2018 as a $734-million investment over 10 years to build and operate 1,500 transition housing, second-stage housing and long-term housing spaces for women and children leaving violence.\n\tAs part of the Province’s new housing plan, Homes for People, the government is investing a further $1.2 billion over the next 10 years to double the number of Women’s Transition Housing Fund spaces, bringing the total to 3,000.\n\tTo date, nearly 1,000 units are complete or underway giving women and their children a place to regroup and rebuild their lives.\nLearn More:To learn about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing",

    "contents": "WEST VANCOUVER – Families and individuals with middle incomes in West Vancouver will soon have access to more rental housing in their community as construction starts on a new 156-unit development.“We’re taking action to help boost housing supply across B.C. This new development will add much-needed rental stock for the people who live and work in West Vancouver and call the community home,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “We will continue to invest in housing like this to support growing communities and deliver more homes that are within reach for people in B.C.”Located at 950 and 970 22nd St., Kiwanis Village West will have two six-storey wood-frame buildings, each with a mix of studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom options. Thirty-six of the homes will be adaptable for people living with disabilities. Homes at Kiwanis Village West are intended to be affordable for middle-income households earning between approximately $51,000 and $145,00 depending on unit type.The development will also feature a community adult day program for seniors and people living with disabilities operated by Vancouver Coastal Health. The centre will provide people with supportive, culturally inclusive health-care services, social stimulation and therapeutic recreational programs in their community.“Kiwanis West Village will provide housing for people like teachers, nurses and small business owners who are helping build West Vancouver into a vibrant and thriving community,” said Megan Dykeman, Parliamentary Secretary for Community Development and Non-Profits. “I’m grateful to our partners at Kiwanis North Shore Housing Society for working with us to create these homes. These are exactly the types of partnerships we need to support the people who are building B.C.’s future.”The project is a partnership between the Province, through BC Housing’s HousingHub program; Kiwanis North Shore Housing Society; the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC); the District of West Vancouver and Vancouver Coastal Health. The Province is providing approximately $55.8 million in low-interest financing for the project, which will be repaid with interest by Kiwanis.“We are excited to develop our first family-housing project, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to serving our North Shore community with affordable, secure and inclusive housing for the past 75 years,” said Patrick McLaughlin, past-president, Kiwanis North Shore Housing Society. “This development presents a unique opportunity to integrate additional housing options into an established community that already serves a variety of residential needs.”HousingHub was created in 2018 and works with communities, non-profit and private-sector developers to increase the supply of rental housing and homeownership options for British Columbians with middle incomes. The Province does not directly fund HousingHub projects. Instead, the Province makes low-cost financing available to developers to build new housing. Through HousingHub, developers receive loans with lower interest rates. The developers commit to pass construction cost savings on to prospective tenants and homeowners through more affordable rents and ownership opportunities.Construction on Kiwanis Village West is expected to be complete in 2026.This project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has nearly 77,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway, including nearly 1,000 homes on the North Shore.Quotes: Patrick Weiler, MP for West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast-Sea to Sky Country –“The high cost of housing is preventing many from being able to afford to live in West Vancouver. The Kiwanis Village West project, supported in part by the Government of Canada, is a partnership between three orders of government and represents a joint commitment to provide housing options for middle-income earners. We will continue to work with provinces and municipalities to get more homes built faster, so that we can foster more inclusive communities.”Mark Sager, mayor of District of West Vancouver –“We are excited to reach a significant milestone as construction begins at Kiwanis Village West. Utilizing a site purchased in 2014 through the district's Affordable Housing Fund, this project will offer local residents housing at 75% of market rents, increase housing opportunities near transit, amenities, and services for an inclusive community.”Judy Savage, president and CEO, Lions Gate Hospital Foundation –“Lions Gate Hospital Foundation is proud to be a partner in this vital project, thanks to our community. Our investment of $3.6 million of donor funds will support seniors living at home and their caregivers. The foundation’s contribution will help improve the supports available to many people in need.”Darlene MacKinnon, vice-president, Coastal Community of Care, Vancouver Coastal Health –“Vancouver Coastal Health is pleased to be a part of this innovative partnership and care model. The adult day-centre program at Kiwanis West Village will provide health-care services and therapeutic recreational programming for local seniors and people with disabilities. This model enables clients to access important supports while continuing to live in their own communities.”Quick Facts:\n\tKiwanis North Shore Housing Society is providing approximately $15.8 million in equity for the project.\n\tThe Province and the federal government, through Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, are making a contribution of $1.4 million through the Canada-British Columbia Bilateral Agreement under the National Housing Strategy to preserve affordability for residents.\n\tThe District of West Vancouver is providing development-cost levy waivers of approximately $1.4 million alongside the project land, valued at approximately $22.1 million, under a nominal leasehold.\n\tThrough donor funding, Lions Gate Hospital Foundation is providing $3.6 million to fund the Vancouver Coastal Health adult day program at Kiwanis West Village.\nLearn More:To learn about B.C.’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/For information about Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, visit: https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/To know about the National Housing Strategy, visit: https://www.placetocallhome.ca/",

We will continue to build on these investments to provide people with affordable housing options across B.C.”Located on city-owned land in Rossland at 1920 Third Ave., Rossland Yards is welcoming residents to 37 new apartment units above a new city hall. The building includes a mix of one-, two- and three-bedroom units and will prioritize individuals, couples and families who are working in the community or have recently retired from the local workforce.Rossland Yards is the result of a partnership between the Province through BC Housing, the City of Rossland, Columbia Basin Trust, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities’ Green Municipal Fund and non-profit operator the Lower Columbia Affordable Housing Society (LCAHS).Construction is also underway on a new 31-unit development at 96 Deadmarsh Ave. in Fruitvale. The new development will provide a mix of one-, two- and three-bedroom rental units for individuals, families, seniors and people living with disabilities.The housing will also be managed by LCAHS, which is partnering with the Province, the Village of Fruitvale and Columbia Basin Trust on the project. Construction is expected to be complete by late 2025.“The West Kootenays is growing and we’ve taken steps to support people living in our communities by providing grants to local businesses and developing more affordable housing, such as Rossland Yard,” said Katrine Conroy, MLA for Kootenay West and Minister Responsible for Columbia Basin Trust. “By investing in projects such as this, we will grow our economy and give people even more reason to stay.”These projects are part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government.

    "contents": "VICTORIA – Building more homes near transit hubs is the focus of new proposed legislation aimed at speeding up the delivery of homes and encouraging more communities near the transit, services and amenities that make life better for people.“Building more homes near transit is good for people, communities, and helps make the most of transit, infrastructure and services,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “But layers of regulations and outdated rules are stopping this kind of development from becoming a reality in too many municipalities. That’s why we are taking action to remove barriers and deliver more transit-oriented communities, faster.”This legislation, if passed, will build on work underway to facilitate more transit-oriented development, create more livable communities and tackle the housing crisis. Earlier this year as part of Budget 2023, the Province committed approximately $400 million to deliver thousands of units at or near transit over the next 10 to 15 years by accessing land that is suitable to be acquired near transit hubs and transforming it into thriving communities.“We’re working to leverage public lands to build more affordable housing in connected, livable communities,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “This legislation is the next step forward to help remove roadblocks and fast-track more transit-oriented development that works for people in their communities.”In some cases in B.C., higher-density neighbourhoods have been established around transit hubs, but in other cases, restrictive zoning bylaws and parking requirements, along with delayed development approvals, continue to slow down the delivery of homes and services near transit hubs. As B.C. continues to invest significantly in transit infrastructure, it is important that this investment accommodates additional housing units to create vibrant and livable neighbourhoods.The proposed legislation will require municipalities to designate Transit Oriented Development Areas (TOD Areas) near transit hubs. These TOD Areas are defined as land within 800 metres of a rapid transit station (e.g., SkyTrain station) and within 400 metres of a bus exchange where passengers transfer from one route to another (e.g., Newton Bus Exchange in Surrey).In these designated TOD Areas, municipalities will be required to:\n\tpermit housing developments that meet provincial standards for allowable height and density. The minimum allowable height and density is based on tiers – at its highest in the centre of the TOD Area – and will differ based on the type of transit hub (SkyTrain stop/bus exchange) and a municipality’s size, population and location. Note: A full list of intended allowable standards is available in a backgrounder.\n\tremove restrictive parking minimums and allow for parking to be determined by need and demand on a project-by-project basis.\n\tutilize standards and details in the provincial policy manual to provide consistency in the approach to developing TOD Areas.\nMunicipalities will still be able to require builders and developers to add parking to accommodate people living with disabilities. Commercial parking requirements will not be affected within TOD Areas. Builders and developers will be able to build as much parking as desired for a project but will not be required to meet a minimum standard of parking units.Modelling future scenarios cannot account for unforeseen circumstances, the changing nature of housing, real-estate markets and other factors, but preliminary analysis indicates the Province could see approximately 100,000 new units in TOD Areas in B.C. during the next 10 years.To support the legislation, the Province will create a provincial policy manual to support municipalities with setting their site standards and moving forward with proposed housing projects.Following the release of regulations and the policy manual in December 2023, the lands that local governments have designated for transit-oriented growth in their official community plans will be immediately captured under the new minimum allowable density requirements included in the legislation.For the remaining TOD Areas that require local government designation, municipalities will have until June 30, 2024, to designate these areas (pending regulation). It is expected that approximately 100 TOD Areas will be designated in approximately 30 municipalities throughout B.C. within the first year of the new legislation coming into effect.Where a local government’s current zoning allows for less density than the new provincial minimum, the new increased minimum density must be allowed by the local government. However, local governments can approve higher density at their discretion.This proposed legislation will advance alongside the proposed small-scale, multi-unit housing legislation (SSMU). While SSMU will add increased density near transit stops, TOD Areas that have higher density will take precedence over SSMU zoning should they overlap.This legislation is part of the Province’s Homes for People action plan. Announced in spring 2023, the plan builds on historic action to deliver housing since 2017, and sets out further actions to deliver the homes people need faster, while creating more vibrant communities throughout B.C.Learn More:For a summary of Backgrounder 3 and the policy framework, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/TOD_Areas_PolicyFramework.pdfTo read the Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Homes_For_People.pdfTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/To learn more about local government housing initiatives, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/local-governments-and-housing/housing-initiativesFor more information about B.C. legislation, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/legislationThree backgrounders follow.\n\tThis project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government.\n\tSince 2017, the Province has nearly 77,000 homes delivered or underway.\n\tB.C. is significantly expanding access to public transit.\n\tOnce Broadway Subway, and Surrey-Langley SkyTrain are completed, B.C.’s SkyTrain network will increase by 27%.\n\tBudget 2023 commits $394 million for the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure to purchase land near transit hubs for TOD Area development.\n\tIn spring 2022, government amended the Transportation Act to enable the Province to acquire land for housing and community services near SkyTrain stations and transit exchange.\n\tEarlier this fall, the Province put forward $51 million in capacity funding to support local governments’ work to update their processes to meet new requirements to accelerate approval processes and build the homes people need.\nMeghan Lahti, mayor, City of Port Moody –“The creation of walkable, connected neighbourhoods in proximity to transit is a priority for Port Moody council and this direction from the Province will assist in achieving this goal. With this said, we hope that municipalities will retain the ability to approve proposals based on their existing policy frameworks with respect to climate resilience, increasing access to jobs and services, affordable housing options and urban design considerations to name a few.”Tom Dyas, mayor, City of Kelowna –“Positioning housing density proximate to accessible transit is smart planning and good policy. It’s why, for example, our recent OCP update in Kelowna was developed in tandem with our transportation master plan. Residents need diverse and affordable housing options that also make it easy to get to work, school and appointments. We look forward to continued collaboration with the Province to ensure there are investments in transit infrastructure that will support the housing objectives needed in our growing communities.”Ken Sim, mayor, City of Vancouver –“Investing in homes near transit hubs aligns with our shared vision for a sustainable future. We appreciate the Province moving forward with legislation that seeks to enable more housing and we look forward to working with the Province to implement these new regulations in a thoughtful way. Make no mistake, our goal is to deliver more housing faster and we look forward to understanding the opportunities and impacts of this new legislation.”Jill Atkey, CEO, BC Non-Profit Housing Association –“This legislation has the potential to unlock new sites for affordable housing development by reducing time and approval barriers for non-profit housing providers. Allowing non-profit housing developers to determine parking minimums on new developments based on the actual needs of their tenants will reduce costs and, ultimately, rents.”Anne McMullin, president and CEO, Urban Development Institute (UDI) —“We see this legislation as a pivotal turning point with the potential to significantly accelerate the pace of home construction in areas where growth is most needed and can be best accommodated. For years, the UDI has advocated for maximizing the billions of dollars of investments made by senior governments in our rapid transit system. Transit-oriented development will help us achieve other societal objectives: streamlined and more affordable commuting between work, home and other destinations; decreased greenhouse gas emissions; and the cultivation of vibrant and healthier communities as people can walk or cycle to meet their daily needs.”Mike Moffatt, founding director, the PLACE Centre – “Outdated zoning rules and parking minimums increase the costs and reduce the number of homes that can be built, driving up rents and home prices for families. With this legislation, which will make transit-oriented development a reality, British Columbia has created a best-in-Canada model for other provinces to emulate.”Rory Kulmala, CEO, Vancouver Island Construction Association –“We welcome any initiatives that look to reduce red tape and to accelerate increasing housing development on Vancouver Island, particularly around transit-oriented hubs and multi-modal transportation corridors. In doing so, it reduces congestion, promotes sustainability and enhances accessibility for all, while fostering healthier and more connected communities, while creating a more efficient, equitable and vibrant urban environment.”Peter Edgar, CEO, Edgar Development –“It’s time to make it easier to build complete, transit-oriented communities and create the types of livable cities that people want to be part of. The time and cost associated with getting multi-unit housing near transit approved and built is prohibitively long. Making it faster to build mixed-use, higher-density communities within walking distance of transit is going to create the kind of sustainable, diverse housing options Vancouver so desperately needs.”Dak Molnar, managing director, Molnar Group – “The way it’s set up now, the rezoning process to build multi-unit rental buildings around transit often takes years, even with city councils on board. This legislation will help speed up the process so developers can add the much-needed types of housing and desirable commercial and community amenities that people are looking for, within walking distance from transit.”Owen Brady, director, Abundant Housing Vancouver – “Legalizing apartments around our public-transit investments will improve affordability and support sustainable planning. More housing near rapid transit means more people will be able to live here without a car. Many-decades-old SkyTrain stations are still surrounded by single-family homes, but it is important for B.C.’s economy, the environment and affordability that we use the land around our multi-billion-dollar public-transit investments intensively and equitably.”Tom Green, senior climate policy adviser, David Suzuki Foundation – “We are very encouraged that in addition to much needed housing, transit-oriented development will lead to complete, vibrant communities. Increasing the housing around transit stations will mean easier access to transit to encourage use, opening the door for more people to live a lower-carbon, sustainable lifestyle.”Shaun St-Amour, vice-president of operations, Clay Construction Inc. – “By allowing more homes to be built around transit hubs, British Columbians will have more affordable living options. Transportation and buildings play a major role in tackling our climate emergency, so today’s alignment of policies creates the necessary synergies for better buildings, sustainable and efficient transportation, and diverse and vibrant communities.”Rick Jeffery, president and CEO, Canadian Wood Council –“We applaud the B.C. government’s new legislation to expedite higher-density housing near transit hubs in communities across the province. British Columbia's ongoing excellence in the global production of high-quality lumber and engineered wood products remains pivotal in advancing sustainable housing. Its versatility, affordability and environmentally low-carbon properties are distinguishing factors in shaping the future of eco-friendly construction. It's not just about building homes; it's about building communities that enrich people's lives with convenience and sustainability.”Many of the specific standards for Transit Oriented Development Areas (TOD Areas), including minimum densities, will be confirmed by policy and regulation.Note: Where a local government’s current zoning allows for less density than the new provincial minimum, the provincial minimum must be allowed. Local governments can still approve higher density at their discretion.The intent for future policy and regulations includes the following:\n\tTwo types of provincially designated TOD Areas at Transit Hubs\n\t\t within 800 metres of a rapid transit stations (SkyTrain)\n\t\t within 400 metres of a bus exchange where passengers transfer from one route to another\n\t\n\tPermitted density within TOD Areas based on:\n\t\ttype of transit hub (rapid transit/bus exchange)\n\t\tproximity to the transit hub station\n\t\ta municipality’s population, geographic location and overall housing market broken down into three TOD Area types\n\t\n\t The three TOD Area types:\n\t\tType 1A: Rapid transit hubs in Metro Vancouver\n\t\tType 1B: Bus exchanges in Metro Vancouver\n\t\tType 2: Bus exchanges in the Capital Region, Kelowna and other medium sized municipalities\n\t\tType 3: Bus exchanges in smaller sized municipalities\n\t\nFloor area ratio (FAR) is the total amount of usable floor area that can be developed relative to the size of the lot.  The higher the permitted floor area ratio on a lot, the more housing units will be permitted on that lot.  \n\tIn Type 1A (SkyTrain stations) in Metro Vancouver, it is intended that municipalities will be expected to permit residential developments in TOD Areas using the following density criteria:\n\t\tprescribed distance of 200 metres or less from a rapid-transit hub – minimum density up to 5.0 FAR, minimum height up to 20 storeys.\n\t\tprescribed distance of 201 metres to 400 metres from a rapid-transit hub – minimum density up to 4.0 FAR, minimum height up to 12 storeys.\n\t\tprescribed distance of 401 metres to 800 metres from a rapid-transit hub – minimum density up to 3.0 FAR, minimum height up to eight storeys.\n\t\n\tIn Type 1B (Bus exchanges) in Metro Vancouver, it is intended that municipalities will be expected to permit residential development in TOD Areas using the following density criteria:\n\t\tprescribed distance of 200 metres or less of a bus exchange – minimum density up to 4.0 FAR, minimum height up to 12 storeys.\n\t\tprescribed distance of 201 metres to 400 metres of bus exchange – minimum density up to 3.0 FAR, minimum height up to eight storeys.\n\t\n\tIn Type 2, it is intended that in the Capital Region, Kelowna and other medium-sized communities, municipalities will be expected to permit residential development in TOD Areas using the following density criteria:\n\t\tprescribed distance of 200 metres or less of a bus exchange – minimum density up to 3.5 FAR, minimum allowable height up to 10 storeys.\n\t\tprescribed distance of 201 metres to 400 metres of bus exchange – minimum density up to 2.5 FAR, minimum height up to six storeys.\n\t\n\tIn Type 3, in other qualifying municipalities, it is intended that transit hubs that meet the service requirements, municipalities will be expected to permit residential development in TOD Areas using the following density criteria:\n\t\tprescribed distance of 200 metres or less of a bus exchange – minimum density up to 2.5 FAR, minimum allowable height up to six storeys.\n\t\tprescribed distance of 201 metres to 400 metres of bus exchange – minimum density up to 1.5 FAR, minimum allowable height up to four storeys.\n\t\nThis will apply only to residential or mixed residential land use, meaning that properties that are zoned for commercial, agricultural (Agricultural Land Reserve) and industrial land uses will not apply. Federally regulated properties, such as the Vancouver International Airport, are exempt, as are First Nations reserve lands.",

These negotiation processes can be drawn out, delaying construction and adding additional and sometimes unexpected building costs. These associated delays and costs can affect people buying and renting these homes.The new legislation, if passed, supports the introduction of Bill 44 to allow upfront zoning, which will facilitate an increase in housing supply in communities throughout B.C. The legislation will require local governments to shift their planning process to an up-front framework, pre-zone land to meet their housing needs and reduce the use of current rezoning processes.As local governments shift to more upfront planning and zoning, the proposed legislation provides high-growth communities with a more efficient and transparent development-finance tool called an amenity cost charge (or ACC). Instead of amenity costs and agreements coming together during the rezoning stage, this tool is part of the upfront planning process, giving builders and municipalities a better, clearer and more transparent understanding of costs associated with a housing project from the start.“UDI is encouraged by this new legislation, which aims to make development charges more transparent and predictable,” said Anne McMullin, president and CEO, Urban Development Institute (UDI). “Combined with the zoning measures announced last week, these are some of the most substantial changes to the development approval process in decades.”The legislation also makes changes to development cost charges and development cost levies (in the Vancouver Charter). Development cost charges are an existing legislative tool that allow local governments to collect funds from home builders to help pay for specific, core infrastructure needs, such as drainage, water, sewer, and roads, before a development is built. Changes through this legislation will allow local governments the flexibility to allocate funds collected from homebuilders to support additional local services and infrastructure: fire protection facilities (fire halls), police facilities and solid-waste facilities that support new homes. Prior to this amendment, one of the only options to recover these costs was through property taxes. Additionally, cost-shared provincial highway projects, such as interchanges and highway exits that benefit the community, such as accessing a new housing project, are included. For example, if passed, the legislation will allow a municipality to use development cost charges to help pay for a portion of an interchange required to access a new housing project for a large housing project adjacent to a provincial highway. Previously, this would have been paid for by the municipality, often through an increase in property taxes or at the expense of other local infrastructure priorities.“As we look to tackle B.C.’s housing crisis and build more homes for people, we need to make sure communities have the tools they need to fund these services in a more predictable way,” said Anne Kang, Minister of Municipal Affairs. “Through up-front funding agreements with builders and developers, local governments will continue to fund and deliver the services people need with more certainty and clarity.”This legislation will apply to both the Local Government Act and Vancouver Charter and builds on the Province’s recent work to support local governments with the delivery of infrastructure projects necessary to enable community growth. This includes the $1-billion Growing Communities Fund launched in February 2023 and the recently announced $51 million in capacity funding to support local governments’ work to update their processes to meet new requirements to accelerate approval processes and build the homes people need.Quotes: Patrick Johnstone, mayor, New Westminster –  “Cities like New Westminster want to see new homes built to address the housing crisis, while funding the wide variety of infrastructure needed to support the new residents of those homes at the same time. I’m happy to see the Province recognize this challenge by ensuring tools are available to local governments so we can plan and fund the fire halls, community centres, and other vital amenities that make our growing communities livable.”Nathan Pachal, mayor, Langley –“As we know, we need to build more housing faster than ever. At the same time, municipalities need to collect fees to build the infrastructure to support new housing. The changes proposed by the Province help address some of the challenges with our current system, including increasing transparency to builders and speeding up the housing approval process.”Marianne Alto, mayor, Victoria –“Recent provincial policies have enabled accelerated home building, which in turn will demand increased municipal infrastructure. This legislation recognizes that, and ensures local governments have the tools they need to fund the infrastructure, and community amenities and services needed to ensure neighbourhood livability. I welcome ongoing provincial commitments to expedite housing, while supporting municipalities as they address the challenges of growth.”Ross Siemens, mayor, Abbotsford –“As a city, we are committed to doing our part in implementing housing solutions for our growing city, but recognize there is a corresponding need to update important infrastructure and community amenities to support integrated growth. The City of Abbotsford is encouraged the Province is expanding and establishing these new tools, which will help municipalities to fund the additional police and fire rescue services, highway improvements and other critical upgrades needed to meet the demands of this new growth.”Bridgitte Anderson, president and CEO, Greater Vancouver Board of Trade –“This new legislation is a welcome step toward more certainty and clarity that will improve the timelines to build the housing we need. So long as fees remain modest to not impact development, replacing community amenity contributions and creating a more proactive and comprehensive framework to plan, build, and fund growth is a positive move.”Trevor Koot, CEO, BC Real Estate Association –“The need to reform development financing was a key finding of the Development Approvals Process Review report, and the BC Real Estate Association is supportive of efforts on the part of government to bring more clarity, transparency and predictability to the fees collected by local government from builders of new housing.”Trish Mandewo, councillor, City of Coquitlam; president, Union of British Columbia Municipalities  –“B.C. residents expect that new homes will be serviced with the infrastructure and amenities essential for healthy, sustainable communities. The legislation introduced today will assist local governments in funding the capital costs of critical facilities for protective services and solid-waste facilities that were not previously eligible. The new legislative tool for amenity cost charges provides more certainty in collecting needed funds for some essential amenities like day cares, recreational facilities and libraries. Other common practices, like funding affordable housing through amenities, have not been addressed under the new rules and our members will be looking for the Province to address this gap.”Learn More: To learn more about small-scale, multi-unit housing legislation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023PREM0062-001706  To learn more about local government housing initiatives, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/local-governments-and-housing/housing-initiativesTo learn more about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436  To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/ For more information about B.C. legislation, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/legislationA backgrounder follows. The Province has introduced legislation to update and streamline development finance tools to assist local governments to help continue to fund the costs of infrastructure and amenities to support increased housing supply and growth. The changes include creating an amenity cost charge tool, and updates to development cost charges, known as a development cost levy in Vancouver.Amenity cost charges (ACCs)\n\tCreates an authority to apply an amenity cost charge that is known upfront in the building process, rather than at the zoning stage, creating more cost certainty for homebuilders.\n\tAllows local governments to continue to impose charges on new development to assist in paying for the capital costs of community amenities (e.g., community centres, recreation centres, libraries) to support liveable communities in areas where they are planning for and projecting increased population growth and housing supply. \n\tTo implement an amenity cost charge, local governments will need to: \n\t\tIdentify areas where more housing supply is planned (based on official community plans and other planning documents) and what amenities are needed to support that supply. Amenity cost charges would apply to new development in those areas. \n\t\tDetermine the amenity cost charge amounts following the rules set out in legislation (for example, the capital costs must be allocated between existing users and new users). \n\t\tConsult on the development of the amenities and charge rates. \n\t\tPass a bylaw that implements the charges. \n\t\n\tLocal governments can waive or reduce charges for affordable rental housing – as with development cost charges and development cost levies. The Province can also exempt types of affordable housing from amenity cost charges. \n\tThe legislation provides the Province with authority to make regulations, which can be used, if needed, to limit or prescribe further requirements in relation to amenity cost charges and processes. \n\tThe amenity cost charge framework includes checks and balances, such as:  \n\t\tCharges can only be imposed on development that results in growth and benefits from the amenities. \n\t\tCharges are restricted to one-time capital costs, which must be shared between existing and new users – developers only pay the portion assigned to new users. \n\t\tRules to ensure clarity for how the new amenity cost charges work with other tools (such as development cost charges) to prevent double charging. \n\t\tPublic accountability measures, such as rules about how the charges may be spent. \n\t\nUpdates to development cost charges (DCC)/development cost levies (DCLs) categories \n\tUpdates the scope of infrastructure for which DCCs and DCLs can be collected to include fire-protection facilities, police facilities, and solid-waste facilities.  \n\tAlso allows local governments to collect DCCs/DCLs for provincial highway infrastructure projects under certain conditions:\n\t\tThere is a cost-sharing arrangement between the municipality and the Province.\n\t\tThe highway facilities, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly service the housing development, like an interchange.\n\t\tThe highway facilities directly or indirectly enable the integrated functioning of provincial and municipal highway systems. \n\t\nLocal governments will need to update or implement a new development cost charge bylaw to implement the new changes.The amenity cost charge framework would generally come into force following royal assent. Government will provide guidance to support local governments in implementing the proposed changes and will monitor the implementation as part of ensuring intended outcomes are met.",

    "contents": "VANCOUVER – Indigenous Peoples and people experiencing or at risk of homelessness in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside will soon have access to new affordable and supportive homes as construction starts on a new mixed-use housing development.“These 103 new homes will help many Indigenous elders, individuals and people living with disabilities have more than just a safe and affordable place to call home, but also a dependable and welcoming environment surrounded by their culture and traditions,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “Our government will continue to seek out partnerships to build homes like these, so people can have the opportunities and peace of mind that comes with a stable, affordable home.”The project located at 320 Hastings St. is the result of a partnership between the Province, through BC Housing; the Government of Canada, through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the City of Vancouver, the Aboriginal Housing Management Association (AHMA), and First United and Lu’ma Native Housing Society.“First United has served the Downtown Eastside for more than 100 years, responding to poverty, homelessness and intergenerational trauma,” said Amanda Burrows, executive director, First United. “We’re adapting again to redevelop our building into a purpose-built facility more capable of addressing these complex issues. In commitment to reconciliation, we’re thrilled to partner with Lu’ma to offer safe and affordable Indigenous housing.”Once completed, the project will be an 11-storey, concrete-frame building with 35 supportive housing units and another 68 rental homes prioritized for Indigenous Peoples. Each residential floor will include shared access to laundry, amenity areas and balcony space. There will also be a rooftop patio for residential use. Floors one through four will consist of the new purpose-built First United facility, offering a range of social services and programming for residents and the surrounding community.Amenities will include two low-barrier drop-in spaces, a heating and cooling centre, washroom and shower facilities, an interfaith sanctuary, a day-sleeping room, an outdoor deck, a computer lab, administrative and program spaces, and a commercial kitchen and dining hall. Residents will have access to all First United services, including two meals per day through the Community Meals program.Lu’ma Native Housing Society will operate the building and will manage the supportive and affordable housing units. Lu’ma will provide on-site supports to the supportive-housing residents, including 24/7 staffing, security, life-skills training, employment programs and referrals to other health and community-based services and supports.Lu’ma will prioritize Indigenous Peoples for the affordable homes. The project will also incorporate design elements to foster culture and community, including gathering areas and space allotted for Indigenous artwork and installations.“We know that affordable housing is a deep-seated issue in Vancouver. To counter this, we need more homes to be attainable for seniors, individuals and those experiencing or at risk of homelessness,” said Joan Phillip, MLA for Vancouver-Mount Pleasant. “This project is an example of how we are working with Indigenous organizations to ensure that supportive, affordable and culturally inclusive homes are made available as a step toward reconciliation and affordability.”Construction on 320 Hastings St. is expected to complete in late 2025. The residential floors will have a separate entrance at 438 Gore Ave.These homes are part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has nearly 77,000 affordable homes that have been delivered or are underway for people in B.C., including nearly 8,000 in Vancouver.Quotes:Sean Fraser, federal Minister of Housing, Infrastructure, and Communities – “Today’s announcement is a bold step towards an inclusive and equitable future. Access to secure housing has a profound impact on an individual’s well-being, ability to pursue opportunities and connection to the community. Together, we build a stronger and more vibrant community where everyone has a place to call home.”Joyce Murray, member of Parliament for Vancouver Quadra –  “Our region knows the impacts of the housing crisis all too well and it is especially acute for our most vulnerable in Vancouver. Addressing this crisis requires each order of government and every stakeholder to play a key role. Today’s announcement shows what is possible when there is a commitment among these actors to work together. These kinds of investments transform our communities and will give residents a true sense of belonging.”Ken Sim, mayor of Vancouver –“The City of Vancouver is proud to be partnering with our government and non-profit partners to deliver 103 units of much-needed affordable housing for Indigenous residents and people experiencing or at risk of homelessness in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside community. We are steadfast in our commitment to address the housing crisis. We will continue to advocate for housing at every opportunity, with a focus on safe and affordable housing for everyone who calls this city home.”Margaret Pfoh, CEO, Aboriginal Housing Management Association –“The housing crisis requires all hands on deck, including all levels of government and the entire non-profit housing sector. Housing is a central social determinant of health for Indigenous people, who disproportionately experience homelessness. We celebrate this collaborative development for offering trauma-informed, culturally supportive homes with wraparound services and hope to see more of this in the future.”Dave Baspaly, president, Lu’ma Native Housing Society –“On behalf of the urban Indigenous Peoples we serve, we are grateful for the partnership with First United Church, CMHC, BC Housing, City of Vancouver and many other partners who made this project possible. These homes will serve the urban Indigenous community struggling to secure affordable housing in the Downtown Eastside, making this project an important effort towards reconciliation.”Learn More:To learn about Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/For information about Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), visit: https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/enTo learn about the National Housing Strategy, visit: https://www.placetocallhome.ca/To learn about the details of the Fist United redevelopment project, visit: https://firstunited.ca/first-forward-redevelopmentTo learn about the First Forward capital campaign and funding for the non-residential portion of the project, visit: https://firstunited.ca/first-forward-capital-campaignA backgrounder follows.\n\tFunding provided for the residential component of this project is as follows:\n\t\tThe Province, through BC Housing, is providing approximately $28.4 million to the project, including approximately $15.3 million through the Building BC: Indigenous Housing Fund and approximately $13.06 million through the Supportive Housing Fund.\n\t\tApproximately $24.4 million in land costs and society equity fundraised by First United, with an additional $9.6 million still to be raised through the First Forward Capital Campaign.\n\t\tApproximately $6.73 million in funding and municipal waivers from the City of Vancouver, including $4.83 million through the Community Housing Incentive Program (CHIP).\n\t\t$5.15 million from the federal government through the CMHC Co-investment Grant program.\n\t\n\tThe National Housing Co-Investment Fund (NHCF) is a $13.2-billion program under the National Housing Strategy (NHS) that gives priority to projects that help people who need it most, including women and children fleeing family violence, seniors, Indigenous Peoples, people with disabilities, those with mental-health or addiction issues, veterans and young adults.\n\t\tBudget 2022 advanced $2.9 billion in funding under the NHCF to accelerate the creation of as many as 4,300 new units and repair as many as 17,800 units.\n\t\tCanada's National Housing Strategy is a 10-year, $82-plus-billion plan that will give more Canadians a place to call home.",

Construction Inc., BD Hall Constructors Corp., and EBC Inc.\nFollowing an evaluation of submissions, the Province will choose the project's design-build team. Construction will begin in late 2024.The 264th Street Interchange area is highly travelled during morning and afternoon hours, including a high volume of commercial vehicles heading to and from the border crossing. Along with allowing more efficient goods movement, the new interchange will include improvements for active transportation, truck parking and public transit.“We are making the infrastructure improvements necessary to support future growth in the Fraser Valley,” said Dan Coulter, Minister of State for Infrastructure and Transit. “Advance work is already underway on Highway 1 east of 264th Street, which will support an upgraded 264th Street Interchange and highway widening as work progresses.”The 264th Street Interchange and associated highway widening is one of the three major construction contracts that make up Phase 3A of the Province’s Fraser Valley Highway 1 Corridor Improvement Program, a multi-phase program to improve goods movement and travel along Highway 1 in the Fraser Valley through the Sumas Prairie to Chilliwack.The other two contracts will be upgrades to the Mt. Lehman Interchange and 3.7 kilometres of highway widening, and replacement of the Bradner Road overpass with 3.9 kilometres of highway widening. These contracts will go to tender in spring 2024 ahead of the construction season. Completion of Phase 3A is expected in 2029.The widening of Highway 1 between 264th Street and Mt. Lehman Road has an approved budget of $2.3 billion.Learn More:More information on the Fraser Valley Highway 1 Corridor Improvement Program is available at: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation-projects/fraser-valley-highway1",

    "meetingType": "Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure",
    "contents": "DELTA – Tougher action is being taken to prevent truckers from crashing into highway infrastructure throughout B.C. as stronger deterrents against unsafe commercial-vehicle drivers will make highway travel safer.Trucking companies involved in infrastructure crashes will see stronger consequences that escalate for repeat offences. In cases where a company has a history of non-compliance, including previous infrastructure crashes, enforcement measures will become increasingly severe. This includes potential suspension and possible cancellation of a company's carrier safety certificate, essentially preventing their operation in B.C.Unprecedented penalties have recently been imposed by suspending a company’s entire fleet, while Commercial Vehicle Safety and Enforcement investigates a crash.  The immediate suspensions and the significant cost they bring to a company will be a permanent tool. However, repeat offenders will face longer suspensions and may have their certificate to operate in B.C. revoked. “Infrastructure crashes have a huge impact. They delay commuters, affect the movement of goods and can impede first responders. This means families, businesses and the economy all suffer,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “Safety is the priority and this issue needs to stop. That’s why we’re taking tougher action, grounding fleets through suspensions and increasing fines, so highway traffic keeps moving safely and reliably for travellers and commercial vehicles, and people can count on their commute.” Recent regulatory changes will also bring in new and higher fines for various offences, holding carriers and drivers accountable for the safe and professional movement of goods on provincial highways. Additionally, new speed-limiter regulations will further improve safety by requiring heavy commercial vehicles operating in the province to have their speed-limiting systems activated and programmed by April 5, 2024. This will prevent these vehicles from travelling more than 105 km/h on B.C. highways. The fine for speed-limiter non-compliance and tampering is $295 and three driver penalty points.“The BC Trucking Association welcomes and supports the decisive measures taken by the provincial government to enhance safety and reduce infrastructure crashes involving commercial heavy-duty trucks,” said Dave Earle, president and CEO, BC Trucking Association. “These initiatives mark a pivotal step toward creating safer roadways for all and underscore our shared commitment to fostering a culture focused on risk-prevention in the trucking industry.”Specific amendments to the Commercial Transport Regulations and the Motor Vehicle Act Regulations bring in new offences and higher fines to address over-height vehicles and loads, as well as require dump-style vehicles to have in-cab warning devices by June 1, 2024. This will alert a driver if the dump box is raised when the vehicle is in motion. The over-height vehicle related fines will be $575 (previously $115), making this the highest fine of its nature in Canada. Not complying with having in-cab warning devices in dump trucks will result in a fine of $598.While B.C.’s new fines for infrastructure crashes will become the highest in Canada, fine amounts are currently limited by legislation. The Province is reviewing potential legislative changes that would allow even higher fines in the future. Learn More:To learn about the new progressive-enforcement framework, visit: https://www.cvse.ca/whatsnew.htmlFor more information about B.C. legislation, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/legislation",

Weather conditions are closely monitored and anti-icing brine is proactively applied when freezing temperatures are forecast. The ministry has also worked with its contractors to improve how plows and tow trucks are deployed during snowy conditions.With any winter-weather event, bridge conditions can be unpredictable and can change quickly. Conditions on bridge structures, especially over water, behave differently than a regular highway. The Port Mann and Alex Fraser bridges are equipped with a cable-collar system to remove ice and snow from the cables. Advanced weather data means crews are better prepared and can activate the systems sooner to remove snow in bad weather as quickly as possible.In certain conditions, a partial or full closure of the bridges and roads may be necessary to ensure driver safety. The ministry will update people as quickly as possible about any closure through DriveBC and its social media channels, and other methods such as signage and traffic advisories to local media.As each weather event can be unique, the ministry and its maintenance contractors will also continue to work closely with local governments on assessing, preparing and communicating for each event as it occurs.During snowy weather, drivers are encouraged to plan and check DriveBC, stay off the road if conditions worsen, and to ensure their vehicle is properly equipped with snow tires if they have to travel.Drivers can also assist maintenance crews by moving over safely when they see a vehicle with an amber light approaching. This allows maintenance crews to clear the snow and improve road conditions, to reduce hazards for drivers and help them get to where they’re going safely.Learn More:For resources on how to stay safe on the road in winter, visit: https://roadsafetyatwork.ca/campaign/shift-into-winter/To check road conditions, visit: https://www.drivebc.ca/",

An increase in height clearance will match the adjacent northbound crossing, which will allow for the passage of taller transport vehicles on the Ferry Avenue underpass.Other works included widening the shoulders and replacing the existing railings on both sides with crash-tested bridge barriers. The improvements make the structure more reliable for approximately 18,000 vehicles that cross daily.“Making this passage safer and more reliable has a huge impact on the people that rely on this crossing to get to and from their work and families,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “It also means our northern industries have better options for transport. The Simon Fraser Bridge is a historic crossing, and modernizing this structure means all travellers in the North can count on this passage long into the future.”The original Simon Fraser Bridge was built in 1963 as part of Highway 97. In 2009, the bridge was twinned with an adjacent two-lane bridge, which brought four-lane capacity to the crossing that serves north and south Prince George.The bridge continues to act as a key link for the northern supply chain, including movement of commercial goods into and out of the North. The improvements will create an easier passage to better support the transportation, forestry, mining and oil and gas sectors.Learn More:For more project information, visit: https://www.gov.bc.ca/simonfraserbridgeproject",

    "contents": "VICTORIA – The benefits and effects of people using e-scooters will be studied in detail to help more local governments across B.C. evaluate how this clean and popular mode of personal transportation can be safely integrated into local transportation networks.“E-scooters are part of an ongoing shift toward electric personal mobility that’s reducing emissions by giving people new clean and affordable options to get around,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “We’re making it easier for local governments to test e-scooters on their own roads, so we can ensure future regulations represent the needs of people across the province.”The safety review will start on April 5, 2024, and run for four years. The review replaces the first phase of the e-scooter pilot project that began in 2021, where the use of electric kick scooters was tested in 13 participating communities over a three-year period. The review enables the collection of better health and safety data, which is needed to address outstanding questions about the safe integration of e-scooters into transportation networks. This will help determine if and how electric kick scooters should be permanently authorized for general use in B.C.During the next four-year period, people will be able to legally use e-scooters in any community that authorizes their use. Participating communities will continue to prescribe how and where electric kick scooters can be used, subject to new regulations. A new streamlined onboarding process will make it easier for smaller and rural communities to test electric kick scooters and address local needs.Visit the project website to find out if electric kick scooters are authorized for use in your community: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/transportation-environment/active-transportation/scooter“Use of e-scooters for personal transportation is growing in communities across B.C.,” said councillor Trish Mandewo, president, Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM). “Local governments have asked the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure to work with them to ensure that appropriate regulation is in place and will welcome the findings the pilot projects will yield. UBCM appreciates this collaborative and constructive effort to address a critical shift in public transportation.”During the next phase of examination, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure will lead an ongoing safety evaluation, together with government partners, ICBC and the BC Injury Research and Prevention Unit (BCIRPU). This work will complement safety evaluations supplied by communities participating in the review.“The BCIRPU is pleased to partner with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure on this important project to evaluate e-scooter safety data relating to injuries,” said Dr. Ian Pike, director, BC Injury Research and Prevention Unit. “This project will clarify any safety and injury concerns, advance our understanding of micromobility and determine whether e-scooters can be a viable mode of transportation on our roads.”The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure will be hosting outreach sessions with interested local governments over the coming months to provide information and encourage participation.Quick Facts:\n\tElectric kick scooters are battery-powered devices with a motor, two to four wheels, a platform for standing and handlebars for steering.\n\tElectric kick scooters are a form of active transportation that has been shown to reduce vehicle trips and help support connections to public transportation.\n\tOntario and Quebec are also evaluating the use of electric kick scooters.\n\tAmendments to the Motor Vehicle Act passed in spring 2023 establish a new legislative framework for testing new and emerging forms of active transportation.\n\tThe government began the first stage of the project in 2021 to test the use of electric kick scooters in participating communities for a three-year period.\nLearn More: For more information about the electric kick scooter pilot project, visit https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/transportation-environment/active-transportation/scooterThe Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure has been collecting and analyzing the results of the first two years of the pilot project. Interim data has been provided by participating communities and a public opinion survey was conducted by Angus Reid Group.Interim findings to date:British Columbians support the testing of electric kick scooters:A majority of British Columbians surveyed see these devices as improving their transportation options. Electric kick scooters represent a convenient and relatively affordable mode of transportation, whether used for commuting, running errands or simply for pleasure.Electric kick scooters have environmental benefits:Data from participating communities indicate these devices promote active, clean transportation and reduce carbon footprint. For example:\n\tKelowna recorded more than 600,000 trips by electric kick scooters and other micromobility devices in approximately two years, 48% of which replaced vehicle trips.\n\tVernon reported more than 470,000 kilometres travelled by users of its shared electric kick scooter provider, with 50% of users using the devices to commute.\nParticipating communities have higher levels of support:More than two-thirds of British Columbians surveyed are supportive of the project, especially in participating communities. Residents in participating communities also have greater awareness of the project. They said they were more likely to use these devices and were satisfied with available clean-transportation choices.Electric kick scooters can help meet sustainable transportation goals:Most participating communities have policies supporting clean transportation and see electric kick scooters as enhancing connections to public transit and addressing gaps in existing transportation networks. Local governments are also using their participation as a way to test e-bike/bike shared-service programs in their community. More data is needed to assess electric kick scooter safety and reductions in vehicle trips.Injuries and conflicts with other road users are rare when operators follow the rules: National data provided by a shared-service provider indicate that 99.9% of electric kick scooter trips end without incident. Of the 0.01% trips during which an incident occurs, only 1.5% are severe (needing more than 24-hour hospitalization). To date, there have been no fatalities in B.C.Overall awareness of the project and electric kick scooter laws is low:Less than one-third of British Columbians surveyed are aware of the pilot project and rules for electric kick scooters. Greater public education and awareness is needed to support compliance.",

We’re proud to celebrate Canada’s contribution of up to $1.3 billion alongside our partners with whom we will continue to collaborate on funding projects that will improve the livability in our region and ensure a lower emission future for our country.”The Surrey Langley SkyTrain project is a 16-kilometre extension of the Expo Line that will run from King George Station to Langley City Centre, the first rapid transit expansion south of the Fraser River in 30 years. Once complete, commuters will be able to travel on transit from Langley city to downtown Vancouver in just over an hour.“This is another important step in moving this project forward from concept to reality,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “The Surrey Langley SkyTrain is going to transform the way people live, work and travel both south of the Fraser and around the region. The stations we are naming today will become community landmarks and will be recognized for decades to come.”SkyTrain station names are selected by TransLink and made easily identifiable to make it simpler for transit riders to navigate the system.“It’s estimated 50,000 new residents will continue to move into Metro Vancouver every single year,” said Brad West, mayor of Port Coquitlam and chair of the Mayors’ Council. “By investing in public transit we are helping make the lives of these new British Columbians easier while simultaneously improving the quality of life and travel for everyone else.”The station name development process included mapping exercises, stakeholder consultation, community and neighbourhood plan reviews, and a study of land-use policies to better understand future development in areas surrounding the stations.The areas adjacent to new stations are key locations where the Province will support transit-oriented developments to create efficient, vibrant communities where people can rely on public transit to connect them to their work and social lives.The project is being delivered through three separate contracts: the guideway; the stations; and the systems and trackwork. Earlier this year, the Province announced the firms that were selected to respond to the requests for proposals. It’s anticipated that contracts will be awarded in early 2024.Advance work has been underway since 2020, including the now-complete widening of Fraser Highway between 140 and 148 streets, as well as utility relocations.Construction on the Surrey Langley SkyTrain is expected to begin in 2024.Quotes: Ken Hardie, MP for Fleetwood-Port Kells –“The Surrey Langley SkyTrain extension will reimagine public transit for Metro Vancouver residents. Once complete, the extension will better connect the communities of Surrey and Langley, minimize travel time, create jobs and get more cars off the road. We are proud to be a part of announcing the names for eight new SkyTrain stations and to celebrate another step forward in a project that will positively impact British Columbians.”Kevin Quinn, CEO, TransLink  –“By announcing station names for the Surrey Langley SkyTrain line, we have crossed yet another important milestone. I am excited to see public transit expanding to more communities in our region and with the station names unveiled today we are one step closer to delivering this much needed service.”Brenda Locke, mayor of Surrey –“New rapid transit is long overdue in Surrey and we look forward to this project breaking ground. The 16-kilometre Surrey Langley SkyTrain extension project will bring critically needed transportation options to the growing communities of Fleetwood, Clayton and Cloverdale. Surrey is pleased to have six of the eight stations along the route, which will improve transit accessibility south of the Fraser River, as well as connect more people to housing, employment and schools.Nathan Pachal, mayor of Langley –“Langley city residents are excited about the arrival of SkyTrain to our community that will be integrated to the bus rapid transit route to the Langley City Centre Station at the heart of downtown Langley city. The SkyTrain cements Willowbrook and Langley city as the eastern downtown of Metro Vancouver, and will be a business accelerator, supporting our vibrant, healthy, people-first, safe community.”Eric Woodward, mayor of Township of Langley –“The Surrey Langley SkyTrain extension is a long overdue investment and expansion in the region. For too long, commuters in Surrey and the Township of Langley have had few options to get around. We look forward to future progress on this project, and the recently announced Langley-Maple Ridge bus rapid transit route connecting to the future SkyTrain network.”Learn More:For information about Surrey Langley SkyTrain, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation-projects/surrey-langley-skytrainFor photos and videos about the project, visit: https://www.flickr.com/photos/tranbc/albums/72177720298782138",

People travelling Highway 1 will see crews in the median undertaking utility relocation, median soil removal, tree clearing and preloading of soil. This work will prepare the area between 264th Street and Mt. Lehman Road for the addition of high occupancy vehicle (HOV)/electric vehicle lanes and other multi-modal upgrades.“The Fraser Valley is growing fast and we are building infrastructure that people need,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “People need to be able to get to work and back home without facing gridlock. We’re taking action to relieve congestion for drivers, to make goods movement more efficient and to accommodate more sustainable transportation options.”The widening of Highway 1 between 264th Street and Mt. Lehman Road has an approved budget of $2.34 billion. This is Phase 3A of the Province’s Fraser Valley Highway 1 Corridor Improvement Program, a multi-phase program to improve goods movement and travel along Highway 1 in the Fraser Valley through the Sumas Prairie to Chilliwack.The centrepiece of Phase 3A will be a new 264th Street Interchange, reconfigured to better serve road users in the region. The 264th Street area is highly travelled during morning and afternoon hours, including a high volume of commercial vehicles heading to and from the border crossing. Along with more efficient goods movement, the new interchange will include improvements for active transportation, truck parking and public transit. The new interchange is in procurement, with construction expected to begin in 2024.The 264th Street Interchange and associated highway widening is one of the three major construction contracts that make up Phase 3A. The other contracts will be upgrades to the Mt. Lehman Interchange and 3.7 kilometres of highway widening, and replacement of the Bradner Road overpass with 3.9 kilometres of highway widening. These contracts will go to tender in 2024. Completion of Phase 3A is expected in 2029.Work is underway on Phase 2 between 216th and 264th streets, with a new Glover Road overpass currently under construction and completion expected in summer 2024. Two more tenders are on track for release, including a new interchange at 232nd Street and highway widening for HOV lanes, along with a replacement to the existing CP Rail overhead.   “People who live in our Fraser Valley communities rely on Highway 1 for more than just commuting. It’s also our connection to schools, sports, shopping and other social activities,” said Dan Coulter, Minister of State for Transit and Infrastructure and MLA for Chilliwack. “These improvements will enhance connections between communities, make transit more reliable and add much-needed active transportation infrastructure to our region.”Further east along Highway 1 between Mt. Lehman Road and Highway 11, advanced site-preparation work is planned for early 2024 ahead of construction on that phase of the program.The scope of the program has expanded and a fourth phase extends through the Sumas Prairie into Chilliwack. This future phase of the Fraser Valley Highway 1 Improvement Program through the Sumas Prairie will address the need for improvements to infrastructure to make it more resilient to changing climate.The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure has committed $30 million to an integrated planning study, which is happening in parallel with flood-mitigation strategy planning work. This study will identify potential future improvements along the Trans-Canada Highway corridor between the Sumas Prairie and Chilliwack.Quick Facts:\n\tHighway 1 in the Fraser Valley serves a growing region, with more than 80,000 drivers using the highway between Langley and Abbotsford, and through the Sumas Prairie into Chilliwack every day.\n\tMore than $65 billion in goods move along this corridor annually.\nLearn More:For information about the Fraser Valley Highway 1 Corridor Improvement Program, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation-projects/fraser-valley-highway1",

    "contents": "PORT MOODY – People in Port Moody are a step closer to enjoying the benefits of a comprehensive transit-oriented community made possible by legislation passed in 2022 that allows the Province to buy land for housing projects near transit hubs.“Building neighbourhoods next to transit makes sense,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “That's why we are focused on creating more communities where people can go to work, school and access the services they need all close to transit. This is the first of many such projects across the province we will be supporting as part of our transit-oriented development initiative.”As part of the master-development plan for the area around the Moody Centre SkyTrain station, the Province is proposing a two-acre parcel of government-owned property be redeveloped to provide hundreds of rental units, child care spaces, health-care services, educational opportunities and retail space.“Port Moody council welcomes development applications within the Moody Centre transit-oriented development area,” said Meghan Lahti, mayor of Port Moody. “The Province’s proposal, although it has not been submitted to the city yet for review, appears to be consistent with council’s strategic plan and would move the city toward the housing targets established by the Province. Development in proximity to the Moody Centre SkyTrain Station is in keeping with council’s goals of encouraging greater use of public transit, climate resilience, increasing access to jobs and services, and more affordable housing options. We believe that this type of initiative would provide much-needed new housing and commercial development opportunities to serve the needs of existing and future residents.”In 2022, the Transportation Act was amended to enable the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure to purchase land in areas near transit stations for the purpose of transit-oriented development. Previously, the ministry was only able to purchase land that was directly related to transit projects.These amendments allowed the province to buy a small parcel of land next to its existing holdings and increase the scope of the Moody Centre proposal. Funding for this purchase came from a $394-million allocation in the 2023-24 fiscal plan, earmarked for transit-oriented property purchase over the next three years.The Moody Centre project will contribute to the ministry’s commitment to deliver 10,000 housing units on provincially owned lands near transit hubs over the next decade as part of the Province’s Homes for People action plan.\n\nThe Province is now working to complete further engagement with the community and local First Nations, and continuing with site studies and design at Moody Centre. Detailed design work is expected to take at least one year.Earlier this month, the Ministry of Housing introduced legislation focused on building transit-oriented communities, centred around creating ways to deliver more homes and services near transit hubs.The legislation complements the changes government made to the Transportation Act. Both are expected to play a significant role in transit-oriented development as the Province moves forward with this initiative.",

    "contents": "DELTA – Transit users along Highway 99 will see quicker, more reliable travel with completion of extended bus-on-shoulder lanes south of the George Massey Tunnel, in addition to other transit and cycling upgrades.“The extension of the bus-on-shoulder lanes along Highway 99 south of the tunnel will make travel by transit even more convenient,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “These upgrades will mean even greater reliability and time savings for those people who use the bus along this popular corridor.”The bus-on-shoulder lane has been extended southbound between Highway 17A and Ladner Trunk Road. Northbound, the bus-on-shoulder lane has been extended between Ladner Trunk Road and 80th Street to tie into the existing bus-on-shoulder lane. These lanes allow buses to travel in their own area of the road, while alleviating traffic congestion for everyone.“We are making it easier for people to take advantage of public transit and to leave their vehicles at home by improving the infrastructure they rely on,” said Dan Coulter, Minister of State for Infrastructure and Transit. “People choosing to use transit along Highway 99 will save even more time with the extension of these dedicated bus-on-shoulder lanes.”These new bus lanes will also tie into the new eight-lane, toll-free Massey Tunnel replacement and existing bus-on-shoulder lanes north of the tunnel to improve overall public-transit reliability along Highway 99. Following some minor landscaping and lane marking, transit users will get to enjoy the new lanes as they are put into service over the next few weeks. Many transit and cycling improvements have been completed in this area such as the Bridgeport Road bus connection, and Highway 99 and 17A off-ramp widening.The Bridgeport bus connection was finished in October 2022 and makes public transit faster and more reliable for people travelling from Bridgeport Road to Highway 99. The project also includes a safer signalized intersection on Sea Island Way that prioritizes buses and protects people when they are crossing the road.Upgrades to the Highway 99 and 17A off-ramp were also completed in October 2022, and are making life easier for people travelling by vehicle and bicycle. Improvements included extending and widening the northbound Highway 99 off-ramp to the Highway 17A intersection to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion, and an upgrade to the George Massey Tunnel bike shuttle stop south of the river.These transit and cycling improvements, and the new five-lane Steveston Interchange under construction, are part of the Highway 99 Tunnel Program, the centerpiece of which is a new eight-lane, toll-free immersed tube tunnel.The new tunnel to replace the George Massey Tunnel on Highway 99 will have three vehicle lanes and a dedicated transit lane in each direction, with a separated active transportation corridor for cyclists and pedestrians for the first time ever. The Fraser River Tunnel Project is currently in procurement.Learn More: To learn about these improvements and the Highway 99 Tunnel Program, visit: https://www.highway99tunnel.ca",
