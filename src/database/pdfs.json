No public correspondence was received at the Public Hearing.\nStaff worked with the applicant to address the above issues in the following ways:\n• Detailed architectural and landscape plans have been provided to demonstrate that the proposed development is generally consistent with the Development Permit guidelines for multi-family projects and Arterial Road Guidelines for Townhouses in the OCP.\n• Detailed landscape plans have been submitted and provides a mix of coniferous and deciduous replacement trees, which meet the bylaw size requirements.\n• The applicant has refined the design of the retaining wall and has provided handrails for the proposed steps by the southwest corner of the site as per BC Building Code requirements.\n• The hedge on-site is proposed to be relocated to the rear of the site and integrated as part of the landscaping.\n• The design of the outdoor amenity area for this townhouse development includes a children's play structure and a bench for parental interaction and to promote social interaction surrounded by landscaping.\n• The proposed accessibility features include aging-in-place features in all units and one convertible unit.\n• The applicant has provided a sustainability strategy and a letter from a Certified Energy Advisor indicating that the project will achieve Step 3 of the BC Energy Step Code with Low Carbon Emission Systems, consistent with current City regulations.\nStaff Comments\nThe proposed scheme attached to this report has satisfactorily addressed the significant urban design issues and other staff comments identified as part of the review of the subject Development Permit application (Plans #1 to #20). In addition, it complies with the intent of the applicable sections of the Official Community Plan and is generally in compliance with the \"Low Density Townhouses (RTL4)\" zone, except for the zoning variance noted below.\nZoning Compliance/Variance (staff comments in bold)\nThe applicant requests to vary the provisions of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 to reduce the minimum lot width from 50.0 m to 40.2 m.\nStaff supports the proposed variance as the proposal is generally consistent with the guiding principles of the Arterial Road Land Use Policy and guidelines. The need for this variance was identified in the rezoning staff report and no concerns were raised during the Public Hearing at rezoning stage. The applicant was unable to acquire the adjacent site to the north to increase the lot width as the owner advised they were not interested in selling.",

One of the townhouse units is proposed to contain a ground-level secondary suite. The site is being rezoned from \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\" and \"Two-Unit Dwellings (RD1)\" zones to the \"Low Density Townhouses (RTL4)\" zone for this project under Bylaw 10081 (RZ 18-839945), which is currently at third reading. A Servicing Agreement is required as a condition of Building Permit issuance and includes, but is not limited to, the following improvements:\n• Removal of existing sidewalk and replacement with a new 1.5 m concrete sidewalk at the property line and minimum 1.5 m wide landscaped boulevard with street trees behind the existing curb;\n• Removal of the existing driveway crossings and replacement with the frontage works described above; and\n• Construction of a new driveway crossing designed to provide \"right in, right out\" access to the site.\nDevelopment Information\nPlease refer to attached Development Application Data Sheet (Attachment 1) for a comparison of the proposed development data with the relevant Bylaw requirements.\nBackground\nDevelopment surrounding the subject site is as follows:\nTo the north: Single-family dwellings fronting Bonavista Drive on lots zoned \"Single-Detached (RS 1/B).\"\nTo the south: Across Steveston Highway, single-family dwellings on lots zoned \"Single-Detached (RS 1/B)\", which are identified for compact lot coach house development under the Arterial Road Land Use Policy.\nTo the east and west: Single-family dwellings on a lot zoned \"Single Detached (RS 1/E)\", which are identified for townhouse development under the Arterial Road Land Use Policy.\nRezoning and Public Hearing Results\nThe Public Hearing for the rezoning of this site was held on October 21, 2019. No concerns regarding the rezoning application was expressed at the Public Hearing.\n7317348\nDecember 18, 2023\n- 3 -\nDP 20-919145\nStaff Comments\nThe proposed scheme attached to this report has satisfactorily addressed the significant urban design issues and other staff comments identified as part of the review of the subject Development Permit application. In addition, it complies with the intent of the applicable sections of the Official Community Plan (OCP) and is generally in compliance with the \"Low Density Townhouse (RTL4)\", except for the zoning variance noted below.\nZoning Compliance/Variance (staff comments in bold)\nThe applicant requests to vary the provisions of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 to reduce the front yard setback along Steveston Highway from 6.0 m to 4.50 m. Staff supports the proposed variance as it is consistent with the Development Permit Guidelines for Townhouses on arterial roads in the OCP, which support front yard setbacks at 4.5 m (14.8 ft.) where a 6 m (19.7 ft.) rear yard setback to both the ground and second floors of the rear units is provided. The result will provide a wider space between the rear units of the subject development and the single-family dwellings that back onto the subject site. It will also provide a larger buffer to accommodate tree retention along the rear property line. The resulting distance from the back of the curb to the building face would be approximately 8.47 m. The reduced front yard setback does not compromise tree preservation or tree planting opportunities along the site frontage. The proposed architectural design provides appropriate building articulation and interface with neighboring properties. To address the road traffic noise from Steveston Highway, the project acoustical engineer confirmed that the proposed development is designed to meet the interior noise limits as per the CMHC standards. This variance was identified at the rezoning stage, and no concerns were identified at that time.\nAdvisory Design Panel Comments\nThe Advisory Design Panel (ADP) has reviewed the project and supports it. A copy of the relevant excerpt from the Advisory Design Panel Minutes from Thursday, July 20, 2023 is attached for reference (Attachment 2). The design response from the applicant has been included immediately following the specific Design Panel comments and is identified in 'bold italics'.\nAnalysis\nConditions of Adjacency\n• The proposed form, massing and orientation of the buildings are compatible with the existing adjacent developments on the block.\n• While three-storey units are proposed along Steveston Highway, the building height is stepped down to two-storeys along the east property line to provide appropriate transition to the adjacent single-family home. Along the west property line, an entry driveway is being proposed and the three-storey building will be set back 9.42 m from the west property line.\n• Two-storey units in duplex form, as well as the outdoor amenity area, are proposed along the rear (north) property line to minimize privacy and overlook concerns.",
