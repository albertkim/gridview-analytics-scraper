Ltd. (Balraj Singh Sanghera and Rajbir Kaur Chatha), to rezone 11831/11833 Seabrook Crescent from the “Single Detached (RS1/E)” zone to the “Single Detached (RS2/B)” zone in order to permit the property to be subdivided into two single-family lots, each with vehicle access from Seabrook Crescent. A location map and aerial photo are provided in Attachment 1. The proposed subdivision plan and draft site plan are provided in Attachment 2.\n\nFindings of Fact\nA Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached (Attachment 3).\n\nSubject Site Existing Housing Profile\nThe subject site contains an existing un-stratified non-conforming duplex (two-unit dwelling), which will be demolished prior to subdivision. Both dwelling units are currently tenant occupied and do not contain any secondary suites. The applicant has indicated that the tenants are aware of the redevelopment proposal and the applicant will ensure compliance with the Residential Tenancy Act.\n\nSurrounding Development\nDevelopment immediately surrounding the site is as follows:\nTo the North: A single-family houses on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”.\nTo the South: A single-family houses on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”.\nTo the East: Across the lane, an existing duplex on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)” fronting onto No. 5 Road. There is a Rezoning application and Development Permit (RZ 22-019002/DP 23-028942) at 10111/10113 No. 5 Road to permit the development of three front-back duplex lots. The rezoning application received third reading on October 16, 2023.\nTo the West: Across Seabrook Crescent, an existing duplex on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”.\n\nRelated Policies & Studies\nOfficial Community Plan\nThe subject site is designated as “Neighbourhood Residential” in the Official Community Plan (OCP).

The Policy permits a majority of lots within the Policy Area (including the subject property) to be rezoned and subdivided in accordance with the provisions of the “Single Detached (RS1/E)” zone.\n\nThe subject site is currently occupied by a legal duplex. Section 2.3.7 of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 provides that the Lot Size Policy does not apply to a rezoning that a legal duplex and which are intended to be subdivided into no more than two single-family lots. The proposed rezoning and subdivision complies with Section 2.3.7 and would result in the creation of two single-family lots being 444.9 m2 and 450.2 m2 in area. Further, the proposed rezoning and subdivision would comply with the minimum lot dimensions and size applicable to the “Single Detached (RS2B)” zone.\n\nMinistry of Transportation & Infrastructure Approval\nAs the subject site is located within 800 m of an intersection of a Provincial Limited Access Highway and a City road, this redevelopment proposal was referred to the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MOTI) for review and comment. Preliminary confirmation has been received from MOTI indicating that they have no objections to the proposed redevelopment. Final approval from MOTI is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\n\nFloodplain Management Implementation Strategy\nThe proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\n\nPublic Consultation\nA rezoning sign has been installed on the subject property. Staff have not received any comments from the public about the rezoning application in response to the placement of the rezoning sign on the property.\n\nShould the Planning Committee endorse this application and Council grant first reading to the rezoning bylaw, the bylaw will be forwarded to a Public Hearing, where any area resident or interested party will have an opportunity to comment.\n\nPublic notification for the Public Hearing will be provided as per the Local Government Act and the City’s Zoning Bylaw 8500.\n\nPLN - 41\n",

The applicant has been advised that encroachment into the SRW is not permitted. A City Covenant is registered on both 10840 and 10860 Bonavista Gate Titles that restrict the development to a duplex, therefore, the duplex covenants must be discharged from Title prior to the final adoption of the rezoning bylaw. There is a Land Tax Deferment Act Agreement currently registered on the 10840 Bonavista Gate Title (proposed Lot A), which allows the property owner to defer the payment of taxes. All deferred taxes must be paid and the agreement must be discharged from Title prior to the preparation and registration of any legal documents associated with this rezoning application.\n\nTransportation and Site Access: Vehicle access is proposed to be from Bonavista Gate for both of the proposed lots. The existing driveways will be removed and new driveways will be constructed as detailed in the Site Servicing and Frontage Improvements sub-section of this report. Two parking spaces will be provided for each dwelling unit in the garage.\n",

(Directors: Amar Gill and Jasdeep Uppal) have applied to the City of Richmond for permission to rezone 10511 Lassam Road from the \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\" zone to the \"Single Detached (RS2/B)\" zone, to permit the property to be subdivided to create two single-family lots with access from Lassam Road. A map and aerial photograph showing the location of the subject site is included in Attachment 1. The proposed subdivision is provided in Attachment 2.\nFindings of Fact: A Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached (Attachment 3).\nSubject Site Existing Housing Profile: There is an existing single-family dwelling on the subject property which is currently vacant and proposed to be demolished. There are no existing secondary suites in the dwelling.\nSurrounding Development: Development immediately surrounding the subject site is as follows:\nTo the North: A school (James McKinney Elementary School) on a lot zoned \"School & Institutional Use (SI)\", accessed from Lassam Road.\nTo the South: A single-family dwelling on a property zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/B)\", accessed from Lassam Road.\nTo the East: Across Lassam Road, single-family dwellings on lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\", accessed from Lassam Road.\nTo the West: The parking area for a school (James McKinney Elementary School) on a lot zoned \"School & Institutional Use (SI)\", accessed from Lassam Road.\nRelated Policies & Studies\nOfficial Community Plan/Steveston Planning Area: The subject property is located in the Steveston planning area and is designated as \"Neighbourhood Residential\" in the Official Community Plan (OCP). The property is designated for \"Single Family\" use in the Steveston Area Plan. The proposed rezoning and subdivision are consistent with these designations.\nPLN - 8\nNovember 6, 2023\n- 3 -\nRZ 22-011080\n7404492\nSingle Family Lot Size Policy 5420/Zoning Bylaw 8500: The subject property is located within the area covered by Lot Size Policy 5420, adopted by City Council in 1989, and subsequently amended by Council on August 7, 1992, and on August 21, 1995 (Attachment 4). The Policy permits properties along Lassam Road to be rezoned and subdivided in accordance with the provisions of the \"Single Detached (RS2/B)\" zone (minimum 12 m wide lots). Each proposed lot at the subject site will be approximately 12.6 m (41 ft.) wide and approximately 575 m² (6,189.25 ft²) in area which conforms to the RS2/B zone. The proposed rezoning complies with the Lot Size Policy.\nFloodplain Management Implementation Strategy: The proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\nPublic Consultation: In accordance with the City's Early Public Notification Policy No. 1316, a notice of the development proposal was provided to residents within 100 metres of the subject site. In addition, a rezoning sign has been installed on the subject property. Staff have not received any comments from the public about the rezoning application in response to the early public notification or placement of the rezoning sign on the property. Should the Planning Committee endorse this application and Council grant first reading to the rezoning bylaw, the bylaw will be forwarded to a Public Hearing, where any area resident or interested party will have an opportunity to comment. Public notification for the Public Hearing will be provided as per the Local Government Act and the City's Zoning Bylaw 8500.\nAnalysis: This redevelopment proposes to rezone and subdivide an existing single-family lot into two new single-family lots with vehicular access for both new lots off Lassam Road. This rezoning and subdivision is consistent with the emerging lot fabric and vehicular access along Lassam Road.\nExisting Legal Encumbrances: There is an existing 3 m wide Statutory Right-of-Way (SRW) for City sanitary service that covers a small portion of the property in the southwest corner which will be expanded and widened northward with utility upgrades. The applicant has been advised that no building encroachment into the SRW is permitted.\nTransportation and Site Access: The subject site currently has vehicular access from a driveway letdown along Lassam Road. In accordance with the Residential Lot (Vehicular) Access Regulation Bylaw 7222, vehicle access to proposed Lot 1 and proposed Lot 2 will be from Lassam Road.\nPLN - 9\n",

Policy Context\nThe Vancouver Plan, Cambie Corridor Plan, Cambie Corridor Public Realm Plan, Marpole Community Plan, Housing Needs Report, Housing Vancouver Strategy, and various other policies and by-laws are relevant to this application.\nThe City approved a Plan for the next 30 years, which will be implemented over the next two to four years. The site is located within the Cambie Corridor Plan area, which is aligned with the Vancouver Plan. The Cambie Corridor Plan allows for rezoning for a residential building up to six storeys with a floor space ratio (FSR) up to 2.5. An additional partial floor is permitted for common amenity space. \n\nOn April 27, 2022, Council received a Housing Needs Report (HNR) prepared by staff. The Council must consider the most recent HNR when developing or amending a development plan related to affordable housing, rental housing, and special needs housing. The proposed zoning amendment would facilitate the delivery of secured rental housing, including below-market rental units, and address the data and findings within the HNR.\n\nThe rezoning proposal is for two six-storey residential buildings with 146 secured-market units.\n",
