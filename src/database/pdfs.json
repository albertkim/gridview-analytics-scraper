RECOMMENDATION: THAT Council direct the City Solicitor to bring forward a bylaw to authorize entering into a Housing Agreement in respect to the 20 non-market housing units developed under the Rental Use Zoning Policy at 6438 Bymepark Drive, substantially on the terms outlined in this report. REPORT 1.0 INTRODUCTION On 2020 July 27, Council adopted Rezoning #I8-09, authorizing Polygon Homes (Polygon) to develop the property at 6438 Bymepark Drive with a five storey apartment building of 53 apartment units along with 43 townhouses. Subject to the initial 2019 Rental Use Zoning Policy, 20 units on the site are required to be inclusionary non-market rental units rented at Burnaby Affordable rates (i.e. 20% below CMHC Average Rents) and these units will be accommodated within the apartment building on the site. Tikva Housing Society (Tikva) successfully applied for BC Housing funds through the Community Housing Fund (CHF) program and approached Polygon to purchase and operate the non-market units. On 2022 May 9, Council adopted housing agreement business terms for all projects developed under the Rental Use Zoning Policy (RUZP). The adopted business terms have formed the basis of a forthcoming housing agreement template for all RUZP projects to facilitate expediency. The project at 6438 Bymepark Drive is the first RUZP project that staff have been advised of potential non-profit society purchase and operation of the non-market units within the development and the use of BC Housing funding. To: Chief Administrative Officer From: General Manager Planning and Development Re: Tikva Housing Society/Polygon Homes Housing Agreement Bylaw 6438 Byrnepark Drive Rezoning Reference U18-09 2023 January 6. Page 2 Pursuant to Section 483 of the Local Government Act, local governments may secure non-market or special needs housing through a Housing Agreement. Housing Agreements secure details such as rent levels, income testing requirements, and target populations, and are filed on land title under Legal Notations. Housing Agreements are the legal instrument that can be used to secure provisions when the local government does not own the land. All current and future owners of the development are subject to the terms of a Housing Agreement. Housing Agreements are adopted by bylaw and generally, are accompanied by Section 219 covenants for enforcement. Staff recommend the 20 non-market housing units within the larger development be secured through a Housing Agreement bylaw and Section 219 covenant. 2.0 POLICY CONTEXT There are several City policies that support the provision of non-market housing in Burnaby including: the HOME: Housing and Homelessness Strategy (2021), Burnaby Housing Needs Report (2021), Mayor's Task Force on Community Housing Final Report (2019), Corporate Strategic Plan (2022), Burnaby Social Sustainability Strategy (2011), Burnaby Economic Development Strategy (2007), and Official Community Plan (1997). The City's Rental Use Zoning Policy encourages non-profit operation of inclusionary non-market units. 3.0 DISCUSSION Tikva was selected as a successful proponent for BC Housing CHF funding for its proposal to purchase and operate 20 non-market rental housing units in Polygon's development at 6438 Byrnepark Drive. The CHF program specifically targets housing for families, seniors and persons with disabilities, and has prescribed rental rates and income eligibility criteria for all funded housing. The program requires three levels of affordability in each funded project: deep subsidy, rent geared to income and affordable market rental. The Housing Agreement terms for this project align with the terms for RUZP projects adopted by Council in 2022, except for affordability and income eligibility requirements. At its meeting on 2022 December 12, Council authorized staff to use an average of overall Inclusionary Unit rents for this and other RUZP projects that will be operated by non-profit societies using operating subsidies from BC Housing, as long as the average rent meets or exceeds the City's required affordability level under the Rental Use Zoning Policy. Additionally, the RUZP requires that all inclusionary unit tenants have incomes at or below BC Housing's Housing Income Limits (HILs). The CHF funding program allows for households with incomes above HILs to tenant the affordable market units. As such. Council authorized staff to allow tenant households of the affordable market units to have incomes not greater than BC Housing's low and moderate income limits. In summary, the Housing Agreement for this development will align with the Council adopted terms for RUZP projects, except that an averaging of rents will be used to meet the affordability requirement.\n",

Prepare and advance Rezoning Bylaw to First Reading and Public Hearing at a future date.\n2. Approve amendment to Brentwood Town Centre Development Plan.\n3. Authorize introduction of Highway Closure Bylaw.\n4. Approve sale of City-owned property for inclusion in development site.\n5. Establish prerequisites for completion of rezoning.\nChief Administrative Officer's Comments: Concur with General Manager Planning and Development's recommendation.\nExecutive Summary: Rezoning application received for Phase 1 of Bassano Site Master Plan. Recommend forwarding to future Public Hearing.\nPolicy Section: Proposed rezoning consistent with various policies and plans adopted by Council.\nBackground: On July 25, 2022, Council granted Final Adoption to Rezoning Reference #17-14 for Bassano Site Conceptual Master Plan.\nDevelopment includes street-fronting townhouses. The subject site is Phase 1 of the three-phased Master Plan.\n\nOn October 04, 2021, Council approved a report endorsing a density and rental obligation transfer between the subject site and 5650 Beresford Street (Beresford Site), owned by the applicant. This transfer aims to create a fully non-market rental project at the Beresford Site. The Beresford Site will initially serve as rental housing for displaced tenants from development sites within the Metrotown Downtown Plan Area and beyond. These tenants will be relocated while their replacement rental unit is being constructed. The rental units will be delivered before or at the same time as Phase 1 of the Bassano Site. These units will fulfill the inclusionary rental requirement for Phases 1 and 2 of the Bassano Site, as well as the inclusionary requirement for the Beresford Site. Displaced residents from other developments can temporarily reside at the Beresford Site until their new unit is ready. Tenants will only be responsible for the portion of rent equivalent to their rent at the time of rezoning, with the developer paying any additional rent. Once Phase 3 of the Bassano Site is completed, the required rental units at the Beresford Site will revert to standard inclusionary rental rates, set at 20% below CMHC median market rates for the Southeast Burnaby rental survey area. Phase 3 of the Bassano Site will include a non-market rental podium to meet the overall inclusionary rental requirement for both the Bassano and Beresford Sites. Additional voluntary rental units at the Beresford or Bassano Site, utilizing RMr density, can be a mix of market and non-market rental units on a 1:1 basis as permitted under the Rental Use Zoning Policy. A density transfer between the two sites is proposed to facilitate this. Further details on the proposed swing site concept can be found in the Beresford Site rezoning report (Rezoning Reference #21-29), which is also on Council's agenda.\n",

Thereafter, these two parcels were consolidated and are now referred to together as 4330 Kingsway (see attached Sketch #1).\nThe initial purpose of the rezoning application was to rezone the consolidated site at 4330 Kingsway to the amended CD Comprehensive Development District (using the C3 General Commercial District as a guideline), in order to permit the renovation of the two existing commercial office buildings on the site. The proposed renovations include the recladding of the two office buildings and alterations to the site’s public realm and landscaping, as well as the addition of floor area with the intent of improving the street presence of the buildings. It is noted that 4370 Kingsway, improved with a two-storey commercial building occupied by a bank on the southwest corner of Kingsway and Kathleen Avenue, was not included as part of the subject rezoning application, although existing legal arrangements related to shared parking, loading, and access with the subject site were secured.\nAlthough the proposal did not align with the site’s high-density mixed-use designation under the Metrotown Downtown Plan, the rezoning advanced through a Public Hearing and received Second and Third Reading from Council on August 24, 2020 and June 28, 2021 respectively, on the basis that the proposal supports the retention of employment opportunities in the Metrotown area.\n3.0 GENERAL INFORMATION\nThe applicant has submitted a revised letter of intent to include the property at 4370 Kingsway, thus expanding the subject site to cover the entire block bounded by Kingsway, Kathleen Avenue, Kemp Street, and Wilson Avenue (see attached Sketch #1). In addition, the applicant intends to revise a portion of the development concept to redevelop the eastern portion of the site in line with the Metrotown Downtown Plan’s, high-density mixed-use development designation under the CD Comprehensive Development District (using the RM5s and RM5r Multiple Family Residential Districts, and the C3 General Commercial District as guidelines).\nThe revised proposal would replace the existing 10-storey commercial office building at the southeast corner of the site with a high-density mixed-use building comprised of both market and non-market dwelling units, and street-activating retail uses. The revised proposal also includes the replacement of the existing two-storey commercial building at 4370 Kingsway with a future commercial office building. The existing 19-storey commercial office building on the northwest corner of the site will be retained and re-cladded, as originally intended.\n",

Recommend forwarding application to future Public Hearing.\nPolicy Section: Proposed rezoning application consistent with various policies and plans adopted by Council.\nBackground: Subject development site located in Maywood neighbourhood of Metrotown Downtown Plan area. Plan identifies neighbourhood as residential \"heart\" of Metrotown with high-density multiple-family development. Subject properties designated for high-density mixed-use development under Comprehensive Development District.\nThe development proposal aligns with permitted C2 commercial densities. The rationale for including the C3 General Commercial District as guidelines is explained in Section 3.5.\n\nOn April 27, 2020, Council received a rezoning report for the four properties (6645, 6659, 6675, and 6691 Dow Avenue) in line with the adopted Plan. Council authorized staff to work with the applicant to create a suitable development plan.\n\nOn October 25, 2021, Staff provided an expanded site report to Council, informing them of the applicant's intention to revise their original proposal to include the property at 6707 Dow Avenue. This property is designated for high-density multiple family residential development in the adopted Metrotown Downtown Plan. Council authorized staff to continue working with the applicant to develop a plan that includes this additional property.\n\nThe proposed development site consists of five lots and follows guidelines from the RM5s, RM5r, RM4s, and RM4r Districts. The maximum permitted density for the redevelopment of the subject site is calculated based on the proportions of the different residential designations on the consolidated site.\n\nThe existing rental apartment buildings on the subject properties were built between 1955 and 1964 and have two to three storeys. There are currently 112 rental units across the five sites. Vehicular access to 6645 Dow Avenue is from a rear lane, while access to the other four properties is from Dow Avenue. The proposed CD Comprehensive Development District zoning includes the RM5r and RM4r Multiple Family Residential Districts to support the replacement of existing rental units and meet the City's Rental Use Zoning Policy requirements.\n",

Prepare a Rezoning Bylaw for First Reading and Public Hearing.\n2. Approve the amendment to the Brentwood Town Centre Development Plan.\n3. Authorize the introduction of a Highway Closure Bylaw.\n4. Approve the sale of City-owned property for inclusion within the development site.\n5. Establish prerequisites for the completion of the rezoning.\nChief Administrative Officer's Comments: I concur with the recommendation.\nExecutive Summary: A rezoning application has been received for the construction of Phase 1 of the Bassano Site Master Plan, consisting of a high-rise residential building with retail and underground parking. Recommend forwarding the application to a future Public Hearing.\nPolicy Section: The proposed rezoning application is consistent with various policies and plans adopted by Council.\nBackground: On July 25, 2022, Council granted Final Adoption to Rezoning Reference #17-14 for the Bassano Site Conceptual Master Plan. The intent was to guide site-specific rezoning applications for high-density apartment development.\nDevelopment, with street-fronting townhouses, comprises Phase 1 of the three-phased Master Plan. On October 04, 2021, Council approved a report endorsing a density and rental obligation transfer between the subject site and 5650 Beresford Street (Beresford Site), owned by the applicant. This transfer aims to deliver a fully non-market rental project at the Beresford Site. The Beresford Site will initially serve as rental housing for displaced tenants from development sites within the Metrotown Downtown Plan Area and beyond, while their replacement rental unit is constructed. The rental units will be delivered prior to or concurrently with Phase 1 of the Bassano Site. These units will satisfy the inclusionary rental requirement for Phases 1 and 2 of the Bassano Site, as well as the inclusionary requirement for the Beresford Site. Displaced residents from other developments can be housed at the Beresford Site until their unit in the new development is ready. Tenants will only be responsible for the portion of the rent equivalent to their rent at the time of rezoning, with the developer paying any applicable rent top-up. After the completion of Phase 3 of the Bassano Site, the Beresford Site's required rental units will revert to the standard inclusionary rental rates, set at 20% below CMHC median market rates for the Southeast Burnaby rental survey area. Phase 3 of the Bassano Site will include a non-market rental podium to meet the overall inclusionary rental requirement for both the Bassano and Beresford Sites. Additional voluntary rental units at the Beresford or Bassano Site, utilizing RMr density, can be provided as a mix of market and non-market rental units on a 1:1 basis as permitted under the Rental Use Zoning Policy. A density transfer between the two sites is proposed to facilitate this. Further details on the proposed swing site concept are outlined in the Beresford Site rezoning report (Rezoning Reference #21-29), which also appears on Council's agenda.\n",

Recommend forwarding application to future Public Hearing.\nPolicy Section: Proposed rezoning application consistent with various policies and plans adopted by Council.\nBackground: On October 04, 2021, Council approved density and rental obligation transfer between Beresford Site and Bassano Master Plan Site to deliver a fully non-market rental project.\nThe subject site would serve as rental housing for displaced tenants from development sites within the Metrotown Downtown Plan Area and beyond. The rental units would be delivered prior to or concurrently with Phase 1 of the Bassano Site. These units would satisfy the inclusionary rental requirement for Phases 1 and 2 of the Bassano Site, as well as the inclusionary requirement for the subject site. Displaced residents could be housed at the subject site until their unit in their new development is ready. Tenants would only be responsible for the portion of the rent equivalent to their rent at the time of rezoning, with the developer paying any applicable rent top up. After Phase 3 of the Bassano Site is completed, the subject site's required rental units would revert to standard inclusionary rental rates, set at 20% below CMHC median market rates. Phase 3 of the Bassano Site will include a non-market rental podium to meet the overall inclusionary rental requirement. Additional voluntary rental units at the subject site or Bassano Site could be provided as a mix of market and non-market rental units on a 1:1 basis. A density transfer between the two sites is proposed to facilitate this. Further details on the swing site concept and density transfer can be found in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 of this report. The Phase 1 Bassano Site rezoning report also appears on Council's agenda.\n",

In recognition of this milestone, a commemorative cross-Canada RCMP Musical Ride tour was organized and a performance took place at Swangard Stadium on June 26, 2023. The opportunity to host the Musical Ride was particularly meaningful for the community as it provided an opportunity to honour the memory of Constable Yang along with providing support to the local RCMP. The event was a success with approximately 3,700 tickets sold. In addition to the RCMP Musical Ride, the event was emceed by Kevin Lim and featured performances from the RCMP Lower Mainland Intergraded Police Dog Services, the “E” Division, Pipes, Drums and Dancers, Sardis Secondary Drum Line as well as the singing of O Canada by Stephen Scaccia. There were a number of activities for families and many participants opted to stay after the Musical Ride performance to enjoy a beautiful early summer evening at the stadium.\n3.0 GENERAL INFORMATION: The charitable donation portion of the RCMP Musical Ride is a requirement as stated in the Memorandum of Understanding signed with the RCMP in order to host the event.\nSubject: 2023 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Musical Ride\nOpen Council Meeting August 28, 2023 ....................................... Page 2\nIn 2018, the historical charitable donation of $10,000 was evenly split between Canadian Cancer Society - Cops for Cancer and Burnaby KidSport. In 2023, the charitable donation will be shared equally between Canadian Cancer Society – Cops for Cancer and the Honour House Society. The Burnaby RCMP decided on the Honour House Society for their continuing support for First Responders, Canadian Armed Forces personnel and Veterans while the members receive medical care. Specifically, they provided accommodations for the family members of Cst. Shaelyn Yang free of charge and have done so in the past for other family members of fallen officers. As for the Canadian Cancer Society - Cops for Cancer, several representatives from Burnaby Detachment are participating in the Cops for Cancer Tour de Coast Ride this year and the donated funds help support cancer research specifically from the funds raised by the Cops for Cancer.\n4.0 COMMUNICATION AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT: The event success is reflected through a sellout crowd and an overall attendance of over 4,500 members of the community. Feedback from the patrons and from riders indicated that Swangard Stadium is an iconic venue to host this event and the highlight of the tour.\n5.0 FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS: The costs associated with hosting were forecast in January with a net cost to the City of $22,000. As outlined below, due to the event meeting the ticket sale projections and some cost savings including shared stabling and feed costs for horses with the City of Surrey, the net cost to the City will come in at under $7,000.\nItem Projected Actual\nRCMP Musical Ride Expenses $68,000 $52,476.14\nCharitable Donation $10,000 $10,000\nTicket Sales (3699 tickets sold) $56,000 ($55,485)\nNet Cost to the City $22,000 $6,991.14\nRespectfully submitted, Carmen Gonzalez, Deputy General Manager Parks, Recreation and Culture\nREPORT CONTRIBUTORS: This report was prepared by Lucas Bjerke, Supervisor – Sports and Outdoor Recreation, and reviewed by Isabelle Taillon, Recreation Manager.\n",

The purpose of the subject rezoning application is to permit the construction of a five-storey enclosed self-storage facility with two levels of underground parking (see Attachment 1).\nAt the September 11, 2023 Council Meeting, Council raised questions relating to the provision of jobs through this storage use. Prior to Second Reading, Council asked that a staff report be submitted to respond to the questions raised. Staff spoke to the applicant who has expressed interest in pursuing the existing proposal. This report responds to Council's questions regarding the level of employment being achieved through this rezoning application.\n2.0 ISSUES RAISED\n2.1 Provision of Jobs\nQuestions were raised regarding the number of jobs supported by this application. The subject rezoning application is proposed as a self-storage facility business model specifically for small businesses. It follows the model of a self-storage facility that the applicant previously developed, constructed, and managed in Port Coquitlam from 2017-2022. This facility was utilized by residents as well as a wide variety of small and emerging businesses such as clothing companies, electricians, bakeries, IT companies, landscaping companies, and printing companies. These small businesses used this facility to store their inventory, supplies, equipment, and files in the secure and temperature controlled storage units. The facility also worked with logistics companies to store and receive packages on behalf of these small business. Therefore, while this facility only employed 5-6 individuals, it indirectly supported over 200 small businesses. With the clientele of small businesses in mind and the lessons learned from the Port Coquitlam self-storage facility, the applicant sought to provide this opportunity in Burnaby through this rezoning application. This self-storage facility is proposed to have 872 climate-controlled storage units ranging in size, bike lockers for employees, two levels of underground parking, two large industrial sized elevators, and intensive security systems for the broader facility as well as individual units. The fifth floor of the Burnaby self-storage facility is proposed to have a 2,187.2 sq. ft. amenity space that includes a kitchen, a washroom, a lounge area, a coffee bar area, a meeting room, as well as an outdoor amenity area (see Attachment 2). The facility is also located within a 900 m walking distance of the Gilmore SkyTrain Station, providing access for individuals and businesses across Metro Vancouver.\n2.2 Self-Storage Use in Industrial Zones\nConcerns were raised regarding self-storage uses in industrial zoning districts. The self-storage use is a permitted use for this site as set out in the City of Burnaby's Official Community Plan (1998) and Metro 2050 (2022) land use designations that permit industrial uses.\nIn the Burnaby Zoning Bylaw, self-storage uses are permitted in industrial zoning districts only. This proposed self-storage facility combines the M1 Manufacturing District and the M2 General Industrial District. This combination of zoning districts allows for a much more intensified use of industrial land by enabling a multi-storey industrial building. This aligns directly with the Metro Vancouver Regional Industrial Lands Strategy (2020) and City of Burnaby's Official Community Plan (1998), which outline the intensification of employment and floor space on redeveloping.\n",

A Density Allocation Covenant is in place to regulate the transfer of gross floor area (15%) between these areas.\n\nThe Southgate Master Plan was adopted, and on February 19, 2020, the Rental Use Zoning Policy (RUZP) was also adopted to support rental unit development in the City. The RUZP will be implemented through a Master Plan rezoning amendment in connection with this Site Specific Rezoning (SSR) application. Additional density of up to 2.20 for RM5r rental units and up to 1.10 FAR for RM5 density offset is proposed to meet the requirements of the RUZP.\n\nThe site area has been reduced from the original application due to redevelopment and construction in certain neighbourhoods. The RM5r and density offset will only be applied to the remaining phases, referred to as the \"Amendment Site Area\".\n\nFigure 1 shows a map of Southgate's neighbourhood areas and the original site area.\n",

Recommend forwarding the rezoning application to a future Public Hearing.\nPolicy Section: The proposed rezoning application is consistent with various policies and plans adopted by Council.\nBackground: The subject site is part of the Buchanan West Master Plan and represents the first property to be brought forward for site-specific rezoning and redevelopment. The plan envisions high-rise mixed-use buildings, a pedestrian connection, and a new local street. The subject site is located on the north side of Lougheed Highway.\nThe subject site is located on Gilmore Avenue within the Brentwood Town Centre Development Plan area. The site is designated for high-density mixed-use development, utilizing the RM5s and RM5r Multiple Family Residential Districts, and the C3 General Commercial District as guidelines. The site measures approximately 6,016.70 m2 (64,763 sq. ft.) and includes 4141 Lougheed Highway, the City lane to the west, and a small triangular portion of Lougheed Highway. The site currently has an older industrial warehouse building and surface parking. Vehicular access is provided from Gilmore Avenue via a registered easement across a portion of 1934 Gilmore Avenue.\n\nOn June 20, 2022, Council received a rezoning report proposing to rezone the site to the CD Comprehensive Development District, utilizing the RM5s and RM5r Multiple Family Residential Districts, C3 General Commercial District, and the Brentwood Town Centre Development Plan as guidelines. The applicant has submitted a plan of development suitable for presentation to a Public Hearing.\n\nThe proposed development plan includes two high-rise residential apartment buildings on top of a commercial/retail podium and underground parking. Vehicle access to the site is currently through 1934 Gilmore Avenue, and access to the development is proposed via a temporary street within the easement. Vehicular access will also be provided from and to the east once 4199 Lougheed Highway is redeveloped. Pedestrian access is provided from both Lougheed Highway and the future east-west street along the northern portion of the site. The development will be constructed in a single phase.\n\nThe development concept involves demolishing the existing warehouse and surface parking and constructing a 62-storey residential strata building (Building A) in the northeast corner of the lot, and a 54-storey residential market and non-market rental building (Building B) in the southwest corner of the lot. Both buildings sit atop a 10-storey commercial podium, which includes a hotel with supporting amenities and ground-oriented retail units. The commercial podium allows for flexibility in occupancy, allowing the floor space to be utilized for offices or other employment generating uses as permitted within the C3 District.\n",

This revised report clarifies that the proposed non-market rental for the subject site will utilize RM5r District density. No other changes to the form of development, use, or density outlined in the prior Public Hearing report result from this clarification.\n2.2 On June 05, 2023 Council granted Second Reading to Rezoning Reference #22-15 for the Burnaby Lake Heights Master Plan, which established a Conceptual Master Plan framework and companion Design Guidelines for the 7000 Lougheed Highway site. The intent of the Master Rezoning is to guide site specific rezoning applications for a multi-phased residential and commercial mixed use development on the approximately 14 acre site. The subject site comprises phase 1 of the Master Plan, which includes two mid-rise residential apartment buildings, the western portions of the Esplanade (a signature pedestrian boulevard) and the Serpentine (an east-west greenway with passive and active programming), a significant portion of the Forest Walk (a regenerated forest corridor with special activity nodes), and the new north-south street linking Lougheed Highway through to Greenwood Street.\n2.2 The Phase 1 site is located on the south side of Lougheed Highway approximately midway between Bainbridge Avenue and Sperling Avenue, within the Council adopted Bainbridge Urban Village Community Plan. The Bainbridge Plan designates the site for high-density mixed-use development, utilizing the RM5uv-a Multiple Family Residential District, RM5r Multiple Family Residential.\n",

Recommend forwarding rezoning application to future Public Hearing.\nPolicy Section: Proposed rezoning application consistent with various policies and plans adopted by Council.\nBackground: Council previously granted Final Adoption to Rezoning Reference #19-19 for Brentwood West Conceptual Master Plan. Subject site comprises phases 1 and 2 of Master Plan, aiming for high-density mixed-use development and provision of housing options, employment opportunities, and public open space provisions.\nThe subject site is located at the southwest corner of Willingdon Avenue and Halifax Street, within the Council adopted Brentwood Town Centre Development Plan. It is designated for high-density mixed-use development, utilizing the RM5s, RM5r Multiple Family Residential Districts, C3 General Commercial District, and the Brentwood Town Centre Development Plan as guidelines. The site is approximately 7090.08 m2 (76,317 sq. ft.) in size and is comprised of three individual parcels and a portion of Buchanan Street, which is identified for closure under the Brentwood Town Centre Development Plan. Two of the parcels (4430 Halifax Street and 1801 Willingdon Avenue) are currently improved with older commercial buildings, and the remaining parcel at 4488 Halifax Street is vacant.\n\nOn 2023 February 06, Council received an initial rezoning report proposing to rezone the subject development site from its prevailing CD Comprehensive Development District to an amended CD Comprehensive Development District utilizing the RM5s Multiple Family Residential District, RM5r Multiple Family Residential District, C3 General Commercial District, and the Brentwood Town Centre Development Plan as guidelines. The applicant has now submitted a plan of development suitable for presentation to a Public Hearing.\n\nThe proposed development plan for the subject site is for two high-rise residential apartment buildings atop a non-market residential rental and commercial/retail podium with underground parking. The development is anticipated to be constructed over two main phases, with Phase 1 encompassing the western half of the site and Phase 2 the eastern half. However, the applicant has the flexibility and discretion to proceed with build out of both phases concurrently, should they decide to do so.\n\nPhase 1 of the development plan comprises a single 60 storey residential strata apartment building, a 9 storey non-market rental podium with townhouses fronting Buchanan Street, and locally scaled commercial retail units fronting Halifax Street. Phase 1 also includes a shared surface plaza accessed from Buchanan Street to accommodate loading, as well as a pedestrianized commercial arcade connecting Halifax Street through to Buchanan Street.\n\nPhase 2 of the development plan comprises a single 43 storey mixed-use tower, with market rental uses located on the upper floors, office uses in the podium, and locally scaled commercial retail units at the base of the building fronting all bounding streets and public spaces. As identified in the Brentwood Town Centre Development Plan and the adopted Brentwood West Conceptual Master Plan, Phase 2 also includes the closure of a portion of Buchanan Street for consolidation with the development site to enable the realization of a new public square.\n",

The proposed subdivision plan is shown in Attachment 2.\nFindings of Fact: A Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is provided in Attachment 3.\nSubject Site Existing Housing Profile: There is an existing single-family home on the property, which would be demolished. No existing secondary suites are present. The existing single-family home is currently renter occupied.\nSurrounding Development: Development immediately surrounding the subject site is as follows: To the North: A single-family dwelling on a lot zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/A)\" fronting Heather Street. To the South: A single-family dwelling on a lot zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/B)\" fronting Heather Street. To the East: A townhouse complex on a lot zoned \"Low Density Townhouses (RTL1)\", with vehicle access from Dayton Avenue. To the West: Two (2) single-family dwellings on lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/K)\" fronting Heather Street.\nRelated Policies & Studies: Official Community Plan/Broadmoor Planning Area - Ash Street Sub Area Plan: The subject property is designated as \"Neighbourhood Residential\" in the Official Community Plan (OCP) and is located in the Broadmoor Planning Area and is designated for \"Low Density Residential\" in the Broadmoor Area - Ash Street Sub-Area Plan (Attachment 4). The proposed rezoning and subdivision is consistent with this designation.\nPLN - 28\nDecember 15, 2022\n- 3 -\nRZ 21-938262\n7060487\nFloodplain Management Implementation Strategy: The proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\nPublic Consultation: A rezoning sign has been installed on the subject property. Staff have not received any comments from the public about the rezoning application in response to the placement of the rezoning sign on the property. Should the Planning Committee endorse this application and Council grant first reading to the rezoning bylaw, the bylaw will be forwarded to a Public Hearing, where any area resident or interested party will have an opportunity to comment. Public notification for the Public Hearing will be provided as per the Local Government Act and the City's Zoning Bylaw 8500.\nAnalysis: This redevelopment proposes to rezone and subdivide an existing single-family lot into two new single-family lots approximately 10 m wide with vehicular access from Heather Street. This rezoning and subdivision is consistent with the lot fabric, lot width and vehicular access of lots to the north along Heather Street and with the Ash Street Sub-Area Plan.\nExisting Legal Encumbrances: There is an existing 1.5 m Statutory Right-Of-Way (SRW) across the entire rear (east) property line for the sanitary sewer, which will not be impacted by this development proposal. The applicant is aware that encroachment into the SRW is not permitted.\nTransportation and Site Access: Vehicle access is proposed to be provided from Heather Street via separate driveway crossings to each new lot. Parking will be provided in accordance with the Zoning Bylaw.\nSite Servicing and Frontage Improvements: At the subdivision stage, the applicant is required pay, in keeping with the Subdivision and Development Bylaw No. 8751, a $29,200.00 cash-in-lieu contribution for the design and construction of frontage upgrades as set out in Attachment 5. The applicant is also required to pay, at subdivision stage, the costs associated with the completion of the site servicing through a City Work Order as described in Attachment 5. In addition, at subdivision stage, the applicant is required to pay the current year's taxes, Development Cost Charges (City and GVS & TransLink), School Site Acquisition Charges and Address Assignment Fees.\nPLN - 29\n",

Staff have not received any comments from the public about the rezoning application in response to the placement of the rezoning sign on the property.\nShould the Planning Committee endorse this application and Council grant first reading to the rezoning bylaw, the bylaw will be forwarded to a Public Hearing, where any area resident or interested party will have an opportunity to comment. Public notification for the Public Hearing will be provided as per the Local Government Act and the City's Zoning Bylaw 8500.\nAnalysis: This redevelopment proposes to rezone and subdivide one existing single-family property into two new compact single-family lots with vehicular access from the rear lane. This rezoning and subdivision is consistent with the lot fabric and vehicular access of the adjacent lots on Williams Road. Similar applications to rezone and subdivide properties have been approved in recent years on both sides of this block of Williams Road, between Shell Road and No. 5 Road.\nPH - 5\n",

The recommendation for consideration at the meeting is as follows:\nAn extension to Temporary Commercial Use Permit (TU 20-891050) should be considered for three years from the date of issuance. This permit would allow for a 'Vehicle Rental, Convenience' use, limited to the storage of rental vehicles only with no associated buildings and no public access as a site-specific additional use.\n\nWayne Craig\nDirector, Development\n(604-247-4625)\nWC:ak\nAtt. 4\n7114445\n\nREPORT CONCURRENCE\nPH - 92\nFebruary 6, 2023\n\nStaff Report\nOrigin: TU 23-009170\nDA Architects & Planners have applied to the City of Richmond for an extension to an existing Temporary Commercial Use Permit (TCUP) for the property at 8991 Charles Street. This permit would allow for the limited storage of rental vehicles with no associated buildings and no public access. The subject site is zoned \"Light Industrial (IL)\" and the TCUP would permit the outdoor storage of rental vehicles associated with the Routes Car Rental business at 9231 Beckwith Road. The original TCUP (TU 20-891050) was issued on March 16, 2020 for a three-year term expiring on March 16, 2023. The proposed TCUP extension would allow Routes Car Rental to continue storing rental vehicles on the subject site with no public access for up to three years from the date of issuance. There are no proposed changes to the layout or access permitted by the existing TCUP.\n\nFindings of Fact:\nThere are no existing buildings or structures on the subject property. The surrounding development includes the Bridgeport Canada Line Station and a bus loop to the north, office and warehouse buildings with parking and unoccupied lots to the south, a temporary modular housing development to the east, and the Bridgeport Canada Line Station and bus loop to the west.\n\nExisting Legal Encumbrances:\nTwo Statutory Right-of-Ways (SRWs) are registered on Title but do not impact the proposed use.\n\nRelated Policies & Studies:\nThe Official Community Plan (OCP) land use designation for the subject site is \"Commercial\" and the Bridgeport Sub-Area Plan designation is \"Urban Centre TS (45m)\". The proposed TCUP is consistent with these designations. The subject site is zoned \"Light Industrial (IL)\" which allows for a range of general industrial and commercial uses. The proposed TCUP would limit the use to the storage of rental vehicles with restricted access to operators only.\n\nLocal Government Act:\nTemporary Commercial Use Permits are valid for three years from the date of issuance. An application for extension to the permit may be made and issued by Council for up to three additional years. After this one-time extension, a new TCUP application would be required.\n\nPublic Consultation:\nNo comments have been received from the public regarding the TCUP application.\n",

A map and aerial photograph showing the location of the subject site is included in Attachment 1. The proposed rezoning would permit the property to be subdivided to create two lots (Attachment 2), each with a principal dwelling and an accessory coach house above a detached garage, with vehicle access from the existing rear lane (Attachment 3).\nA new site-specific zone is being introduced to facilitate the proposed lot depth of 34.6 m (113.5 ft.), which does not meet the minimum required lot depth of the standard \"Coach Houses (RCH1)\" zone of 35.0 m (114.8 ft.). The proposed site-specific zone is identical in all provisions to the standard \"Coach Houses (RCH1)\" zone, but allows for a reduced lot depth.\nFindings of Fact\nA Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached (Attachment 4).\nSubject Site Existing Housing Profile\nThere is an existing single-family dwelling on the subject property, which is proposed to be demolished. The applicant has confirmed the single-family dwelling is currently rented, and does not contain any secondary suites.\nSurrounding Development\nDevelopment immediately surrounding the subject site is as follows:\nTo the North: Single-family dwellings on lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\" and further north \"Compact Single Detached (RC1)\" fronting No. 4 Road.\nTo the South: Single-family dwellings on lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\" and further south \"Compact Single Detached (RC1)\" fronting No. 4 Road.\nTo the East: Across No. 4 Road, single-family dwellings on agricultural lots included in the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR), zoned \"Agriculture (AG1)\".\nTo the West: Across the rear lane, single-family dwellings on lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/B)\" fronting Allison Court.\nPLN - 32\nMarch 21, 2023\n- 3 -\nRZ 17-777739\n7060982\nRelated Policies & Studies\nOfficial Community Plan/ Broadmoor Area - Ash Street Sub-Area Plan\nThe Official Community Plan (OCP) land use designation for the subject site is \"Neighbourhood Residential\" (NRES). The Broadmoor Area - Ash Street Sub-Area Plan designates the site as \"small lots or large lots\" (Attachment 5). The proposal is consistent with these designations.\nArterial Road Land Use Policy\nThe Arterial Road Land Use Policy identifies the subject site as \"Arterial Road Compact Lot Single Detached\", which allows for compact lot single detached or compact lot coach house development. The Arterial Road Land Use Policy requires all compact lot development to be accessed from an operational municipal lane only. Compact lot single detached (single detached housing with a secondary suite) is permitted on all compact lots with a minimum of 9 m width. Compact lot coach house (single detached housing with a detached coach house unit) is permitted on compact lots with a minimum 35 m lot depth. This proposal is to create a site-specific zone to allow for coach houses on lots with a minimum 34.5 m lot depth.\nThe Policy identifies that Rezoning for the construction of a coach house along an arterial road may be considered on isolated sites identified for Arterial Road Compact Lot Single Detached on the Arterial Road Housing Development map based on its own merit. The subject development has demonstrated that they are able to achieve all zoning and policy requirements on a slightly reduced lot depth so the proposed development is consistent with this Policy.\nAgricultural Land Reserve (ALR) Buffer Zone\nConsistent with the OCP guidelines, the applicant is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw, to register a legal agreement on Title to ensure that a 4.0 m wide landscaped Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR) buffer (as measured from the east property line) along No. 4 Road is maintained and will not be abandoned or removed. The legal agreement will also identify that the property is potentially subject to impacts of noise, dust and odour resulting from agricultural operations. Submission of a Landscape Plan and cash securities to ensure the buffer area is appropriately landscaped is required prior to rezoning bylaw adoption. A preliminary landscape plan is included as Attachment 6, and is subject to further review to ensure that the plan meets all OCP guidelines. The application was not referred to the Agricultural Advisory Committee (AAC), as the committee has requested to review only higher density proposals near ALR land, and relies on staff to secure the landscaped buffer and legal agreement for single-family development.\nFloodplain Management Implementation Strategy\nThe proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\nPLN - 33\n",

The application is consistent with the associated Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR) Non-Adhering Residential Use (NARU) application (AG 22-007162) approved by Council and the Agricultural Land Commission (ALC). A location map and aerial photograph are provided in Attachment 1. The subject property is currently occupied by a principal single-family dwelling, an additional single-family dwelling (the subject of the application), and an active farming operation.\n\nBackground: On September 12, 2022, Council authorized the associated Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR) Non-Adhering Residential Use (NARU) application (AG 22-007162) to be forwarded to the Agricultural Land Commission (ALC). As per the ALC’s decision letter dated January 10, 2023 (Attachment 2), the ALC approved the proposal for a 64 m2 (689 ft2) addition to the existing additional single-family dwelling at 15140 Westminster Highway (Resolution #14/2023). The subject Zoning Text Amendment application is required to amend the “Agriculture (AG1)” zone in order to allow the addition at the subject site only. The proposed amendments are consistent with the ALR NARU application approved by Council and the ALC. More information regarding the proposed amendments is provided in the “Analysis” section of this report.\n\nFindings of Fact: A Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached (Attachment 3).\n\nSurrounding Development:\nTo the North: Across Westminster Highway, an active farming operation on a property zoned “Agriculture (AG1)” and located in the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR).\nTo the South: Across the Granville Avenue unopened road allowance, an active landfill operation on a property zoned “Agriculture (AG1)” and located in the ALR, operating under previous ALR non-farm use approvals from Council and the ALC (AG 14-654361 / AG 19-863866)\nTo the East & West: Single-family dwellings and active farming operations on properties zoned “Agriculture (AG1)” and located in the ALR.\n\nRelated Policies & Studies:\nOfficial Community Plan: The Official Community Plan (OCP) land use designation for the subject site is “Agriculture (AGR)”, which comprises of those areas of the City where the principal use is agriculture and food production, but may also include other uses as permitted under the Agricultural Land Commission Act (ALCA). The proposal is consistent with this designation. OCP policy includes limiting the number of dwelling units to one on lots within the ALR and any proposal for additional dwelling units require approval from both Council and the ALC. The proposal has received Council and ALC approval.\nFloodplain Management Implementation Strategy: The proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw. The proposed addition complies with the exemption provisions in the Bylaw, as the addition would increase the size of the existing additional dwelling by less than 25%.\nRiparian Management Area & Environmentally Sensitive Area Designation: The property contains a small portion of Riparian Management Area (RMA) and Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) designation at the rear of the property. No impact to the RMA or ESA is proposed as part of this application.\nFood Security and Agricultural Advisory Committee: The associated ALR NARU application (AG 22-007162) was reviewed and supported by the Food Security and Agricultural Advisory Committee (FSAAC) at its meeting held on July 7, 2022. An excerpt from the July 7, 2022 FSAAC meeting minutes is provided in Attachment 4.\n\nPublic Consultation: In accordance with the City’s Early Public Notification Policy, notice of the development proposal was provided to residents within 100 metres of the subject site. In addition, a rezoning sign has been installed on the subject property. Staff have not received any comments from the public about the rezoning application in response to the early public notification or placement of the rezoning sign on the property. Should the Planning Committee endorse this application and Council grant 1st reading to the rezoning bylaw, the bylaw will be forwarded to a Public Hearing, where any area resident or interested party will have an opportunity to comment. Public notification for the Public Hearing will be provided as per the Local Government Act and the City’s Zoning Bylaw 8500.\n\nAnalysis: Proposal: The purpose of the subject Zoning Text Amendment application is to allow a 64 m2 (689 ft2) addition to the existing 256.9 m2 (2,765 ft2) additional dwelling for the purposes of.\n",

First reading to Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500, Amendment Bylaw 10423, was granted on November 14, 2022 and was referred to a Public Hearing.\nAt the December 19, 2022 Public Hearing, Council made the following referral: That the staff report titled “Application by Landa Oval Development Ltd. for Rezoning at 6851 and 6871 Elmbridge Way from Industrial Business Park (1B1) to High Density Mixed Use (ZMU52) - Oval Village (City Centre)”, dated October 24, 2022, from the Director, Development, be referred back to staff for further review.\nItems discussed at the Public Hearing were generally related to traffic impacts and concerns raised by residents of the neighbouring development to the east (Ora).\nThe purpose of this report is to respond to the Public Hearing referral and present changes to the proposed development along with related information in response to the traffic concerns raised.\nRevised rezoning considerations are included to facilitate these changes should they be supported by Council.\nFindings of Fact\nThe original staff report and accompanying attachments providing information about the proposed development is contained in Schedule A and remains applicable, except where noted in this report. A summary of the proposed project is as follows: 13,826 m2 (148,822 ft2) of commercial floor area consisting of 189 room hotel and supporting uses in the podium and tower, located in the northeast quadrant of the development site fronting River Road, with remaining at-grade commercial space along the new road (herein called the new west road) and Elmbridge Way. 27,652 m2 (297,644 ft2) of residential floor area consisting of 321 market residential units and 35 affordable Low End Market Rental (LEMR) housing units.

Transportation related infrastructure and works includes: Dedication and construction of the new west road along the subject site’s entire west frontage with one primary vehicle access from the new west road; Lane widening and upgrades along the subject site’s entire east frontage with one vehicle access (restricted) from the lane; and Frontage upgrades along the River Road and Elmbridge Way consistent with current City standards and existing improvements completed in the surrounding area.\nPLN – 9\nMarch 31, 2023\n- 3 -\nRZ 17-782750\n7177484\nAnalysis\nThe following sections provide information on the outreach to the Ora residents to the east, follow-up action to address concerns about current lane operations and changes to the project that are proposed as a result of the traffic concerns raised at the December 19, 2022 Public Hearing.\nDeveloper Led Outreach and Additional Public Correspondence\nThe developer’s project team undertook the following outreach before and after the December 19, 2022 Public Hearing (Schedule B contains a written summary report submitted by the applicant): December 6, 2022 – Initial outreach with Ora strata council members (via Zoom). December 8, 2022 – Canvassing of surrounding businesses to provide information about the development and information about the upcoming Public Hearing. February 22, 2023 – Follow-up engagement with Ora strata Council members (via Zoom) to present information about proposed changes to the project, lane design and measures to address traffic concerns. February 24, 2023 – Meeting with T&T Supermarket representatives (commercial tenant within the Ora development) (Via Zoom) to receive comments about existing lane operations and loading activities associated with T&T operations. March 20, 2023 – Canvassed existing Ora commercial tenants about the proposed project and lane operations. March 29, 2023 – Written letter provided to Ora strata council summarizing project revisions and responses to traffic and lane concerns.\nSince the December 19, 2022 Public Hearing and developer outreach undertaken in 2023, additional correspondence has been received from a resident of the Ora Development and Ora strata council. The correspondence identifies their continued concerns about traffic in the lane, access to the subject site and lane upgrades. The public correspondence and the City staff responses are included in Schedule C.\nA summary of the subject development’s proposed revisions to the project in response to the traffic concerns about access and impacts to the lane are provided below: Hotel pick-up and drop-off functions have been relocated from the lane to on-site within the subject development’s parkade. No pick-up and drop-off functions from passenger guest vehicles will occur from the lane. A gate with access control measures (i.e., intercom and electronic security device/FOB) will be installed for the lane access to the subject development’s parkade. This restriction will limit lane access to hotel guests and on-site employees only and reduce the introduction of additional traffic into the lane. The new west road access will serve as the primary vehicle entrance/exit to the subject development’s parkade and will be required to be utilized by residents, residential visitors, commercial uses and vehicles accessing the oval parking. Loading, servicing functions and a hotel shuttle parking with passenger loading area have been provided in dedicated areas on-site with direct access off the lane and designed to accommodate commercial trucks (i.e., maximum medium-sized SU-9 trucks). These changes are intended to address the traffic concerns raised and improve the overall traffic flow and safety in the area.\nPLN – 10\n",

(on behalf of Khalid Hasan of Pakland Qadri Gardens Ltd.) has applied to the City of Richmond for permission to rezone 7371 No. 4 Road from the \"Single Detached (RS1/F)\" zone to the \"Medium Density Townhouses (RTM2)\" zone, to permit the property to be developed for 19 townhouse units including two secondary suites, with vehicle access from General Currie Road. A location map and aerial photo of the subject site are provided in Attachment 1.\nFindings of Fact\nA Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is provided in Attachment 2.\nExisting Site Condition and Context\nA survey of the subject site is included in Attachment 3. The subject site is located on the northwest corner of the intersection of No. 4 Road and General Currie Road, and is currently accessed via No. 4 Road.\nSubject Site Existing Housing Profile\nThe subject site consists of a large lot containing a single-family dwelling that is occupied by a rental tenant. There are no secondary suites in the dwelling. The existing dwelling is proposed to be demolished at future development stage.\nSurrounding Development\nExisting development immediately surrounding the subject site is as follows:\nTo the North: Is a large lot zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/F)\", containing a single-family dwelling, which fronts No. 4 Road, as well as a portion of a lot zoned \"Town Housing (ZT16) - South McLennan and St. Albans Sub-Area (City Centre)\" containing 22 townhouse units.\nTo the South: Immediately across General Currie Road, is a lot zoned \"Medium Density Townhouses (RTM3)\", containing 20 townhouse units.\nTo the East: Immediately across No. 4 Road, are large lots zoned \"Agriculture\" that are located in the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR), each of which contain single-family dwellings.\nTo the West: Are medium-sized lots zoned \"Single Detached (ZS14) - South McLennan (City Centre)\", each containing single-family dwellings fronting General Currie Road.\nPLN - 41\nApril 17, 2023\n- 3 -\nRZ 20-919143\n7183342\nExisting Legal Encumbrances\nThere is an existing Statutory Right-of-Way (SRW) registered on Title of the property for the sanitary sewer, water and drainage services along the front (east) property line. The applicant has been advised that encroachment into the SRW is not permitted.\nThere is also a notation on Title of the property to indicate that the subject site may benefit from a cross-access easement registered on Title of the existing townhouse site further north at 7331 No. 4 Road. This notation is not relevant to this development proposal because vehicle access to the subject site is proposed directly off General Currie Road, which is the preferred scenario as it avoids vehicle access off No. 4 Road and is supported by the City's Transportation department. Should this rezoning application proceed, the cross-access easement registered on Title of 7331 No. 4 Road in favour of the subject site may be discharged at the request of the strata council of 7331 No. 4 Road.\nRelated Policies & Requirements\nOfficial Community Plan/McLennan South Sub-Area Plan\nLand Use Designations\nThe Official Community Plan (OCP) land use designation for the subject site is \"Neighbourhood Residential\". This redevelopment proposal is consistent with this designation.\nThe McLennan South Sub-Area Plan land use designation for the subject site is \"Residential, 2 ½ storeys typical (3 storeys maximum), 0.55 base FAR\", and is identified as being in the \"C1 Character Area\", which is envisioned for clusters of housing contained predominantly in single, duplex, and triplex form and characterized by wooded areas (Attachments 4 & 5). The Sub-Area Plan allows for additional density to be considered where community benefits are provided (e.g., accessible housing beyond the typical provision; contribution to the child care reserve fund). This redevelopment proposal involving a density of 0.65 FAR is consistent with the Plan's land use designation for the subject site and character envisioned for this portion of the neighbourhood as it includes the retention of several trees on-site as well as the provision of four Convertible Units and two secondary suites. This proposal also provides road and pedestrian network improvements (including road dedication and a special crosswalk), and contributions to the Public Art Reserve Fund and Affordable Housing Reserve Fund.\nSite Size and Residual Lots\nTo encourage multi-family developments of sufficient size to support high quality development, the McLennan South Sub-Area Plan requires a minimum frontage width of 50 m along arterial roads and a minimum site area of 2,000 m2, and the creation of residual lots is avoided. Where a development proposal deviates from these requirements, it must be demonstrated that: access to the site is not off an arterial road and that future shared access to residual sites is enabled; the policy and design objectives of the Plan are not compromised; and the proposal provides a recognizable benefit to the area such as tree retention and enhanced pedestrian environment.\n",

REPORT CONCURRENCE Affordable Housing CONCURRENCE OF GENERAL MANAGER PLN - 22 April 17, 2023 RZ 22-027435 7140712 Staff Report Origin: Bradley Dore has applied on behalf of the owner, Lavocata Holdings Ltd., Inc. No. BC 1388010 (Directors: Caterina Rizzo and Benny Taddei), to the City of Richmond for permission to rezone 9671 No. 1 Road from the \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\" zone to the \"Compact Single Detached (RC2)\" zone, to permit the property to be subdivided to create two single-family lots, each with vehicle access from the rear lane. Findings of Fact: A Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached. Subject Site Existing Housing Profile: There is an existing unoccupied single-family dwelling on the property with vehicle access from the rear lane, which is proposed to be demolished. The applicant has confirmed that there is no existing secondary suite in the dwelling. Surrounding Development: To the North: A single-family dwelling on a property zoned \"Compact Single Detached (RC1)\" fronting No. 1 Road. To the South: A single-family dwelling on a property zoned \"Compact Single Detached (RC1)\" fronting No. 1 Road. To the East: Across No 1. Road, a single-family dwelling on a lot zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/C)\" fronting No. 1 Road and a single-family dwelling on a lot zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/B)\" fronting Peterson Drive. To the West: Across the lane, a single-family dwelling on a property zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\" fronting Desmond Road. Related Policies & Studies: Official Community Plan/Seafair Planning Area: The subject property is located in the Seafair planning area and is designated \"Neighbourhood Residential\" in the Official Community Plan (OCP). The proposed rezoning and subdivision are consistent with this designation. PLN - 23 April 17, 2023 RZ 22-027435 7140712 Arterial Road Policy: The subject property is designated \"Arterial Road Compact Lot Single Detached\" on the Arterial Road Housing Development Map. The Arterial Road Land Use Policy requires all compact lot developments to be accessed from the rear lane only. The proposed rezoning is consistent with this Policy. Prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw, the applicant must submit a Landscape Plan, prepared by a Registered Landscape Architect, to the satisfaction of the Director, Development, and deposit a Landscaping Security based on 100 per cent of the cost estimate provided by the Landscape Architect, including installation costs. The Landscape Plan should comply with the guidelines of the OCP's Arterial Road Policy and include any required replacement trees identified as a condition of rezoning. Floodplain Management Implementation Strategy: The proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw. Public Consultation: A rezoning sign has been installed on the subject property. Staff have not received any comments from the public about the rezoning application in response to the early public notification or placement of the rezoning sign on the property. Should the Planning Committee endorse this application and Council grant first reading to the rezoning bylaw, the bylaw will be forwarded to a Public Hearing, where any area resident or interested party will have an opportunity to comment. Public notification for the Public Hearing will be provided as per the Local Government Act and the City's Zoning Bylaw 8500. Analysis: This redevelopment proposes to rezone and subdivide one existing single-family property into two new compact single-family lots with vehicular access from the rear lane. This rezoning and subdivision is consistent with the lot fabric and vehicular access of the adjacent lots on No. 1 Road. Similar applications to rezone and subdivide properties have been approved both to the north and south on the subject property along No. 1 Road. Existing Legal Encumbrances: None. Transportation and Site Access: Vehicular access to No. 1 Road is not permitted in accordance with Residential Lot (Vehicular) Access Bylaw No. 7222 and therefore will be restricted to the rear lane only.

Ltd. for Rezoning at 8180 Heather Street from \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\" Zone to the \"Single Detached (RS2/A)\" Zone Staff Recommendation: Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500, Amendment Bylaw 10433, for the rezoning of 8180 Heather Street from \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\" zone to \"Single Detached (RS2/A)\" zone, be introduced and given first reading. REPORT CONCURRENCE Affordable Housing CONCURRENCE OF GENERAL MANAGER PH – 6 March 6, 2023 - 2 - RZ 17-791280 7031674 Staff Report Origin: The owner, 1265028 B.C. Ltd. (Director – Xinyu Zhao) has applied to the City of Richmond for permission to rezone 8180 Heather Street from the \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\" zone to the \"Single Detached (RS2/A)\" zone, to permit the property to be subdivided into two single-family lots with the western lot accessed from Heather Street and the eastern lot accessed from Dixon Avenue. A map and aerial photograph showing the location of the subject property is included in Attachment 1. The proposed subdivision plan is shown in Attachment 2. Findings of Fact: A Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached (Attachment 3). Subject Site Existing Housing Profile: There is an existing owner-occupied single-family dwelling on the subject property with vehicular access from Heather Street, which is proposed to be demolished. The applicant has confirmed there is no existing secondary suite in the dwelling. Surrounding Development: Development immediately surrounding the subject site is as follows: To the North: A single-family dwelling zoned \"Single Detached (RS2/A)\" fronting Heather Street that was previously rezoned (RZ 16-737446). To the South: Across Dixon Avenue, a single-family dwelling zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/B)\". To the East: A single-family dwelling zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\". To the West: Across Heather Street, the Garden City Shopping Centre zoned \"Community Commercial (CC)\". Related Policies & Studies Official Community Plan/Broadmoor Planning Area – Ash Street Sub-Area Plan: The subject property is designated as \"Neighbourhood Residential\" in the Official Community Plan (OCP) and is located in the Broadmoor Planning Area and is designated for \"Low Density Residential\" in the Broadmoor Area – Ash Street Sub-Area Plan (Attachment 4). The City has considered a number of rezoning applications in the area, which have resulted in lots between 9 and 10 m wide (11 m for corner lots). The proposed rezoning and subdivision is consistent with this designation. PH – 7 March 6, 2023 - 3 - RZ 17-791280 7031674 Floodplain Management Implementation Strategy: The proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw. Public Consultation: A rezoning sign has been installed on the subject property. Staff have received correspondence from the property owner of 9271 Dixon Avenue, which is the adjacent neighbour to the east of the subject site, citing concern regarding potential construction related impacts of the proposed development. In response to the neighbours concern, the applicant has subsequently contacted the property owner to discuss potential construction impacts. The applicant has indicated that the existing concrete retaining wall and fence are intended to remain in place and that a new timber retaining wall, where applicable, would be constructed adjacent to the existing concrete retaining wall (Attachment 5). No other correspondence from the public has been received. Should the Planning Committee endorse this application and Council grant first reading to the rezoning bylaw, the bylaw will be forwarded to a Public Hearing, where any area resident or interested party will have an opportunity to comment. Public notification for the Public Hearing will be provided as per the Local Government Act and the City's Zoning Bylaw 8500. Analysis: This redevelopment proposes to rezone and subdivide an existing single-family lot into two new single-family lots with vehicular access for Lot 1 (the corner lot) off Heather Street and access to Lot 2 off Dixon Avenue. This rezoning and subdivision is consistent with the lot fabric and vehicular access of lots to the north and south along Heather Street. Similar applications to rezone and subdivide properties have been approved in recent years along Heather Street. In keeping with the City's urban design objectives for enhanced design on corner lots, the applicant will be required to provide a landscape plan and register a restrictive covenant on Title to ensure that the development's design is consistent with the approved plans. A conceptual plan is provided in Attachment 6. Existing Legal Encumbrances: There is an existing 3.0 m wide by 1.5 m wide Statutory Right-of-Way (SRW) located in the southeast corner of the property for an existing sanitary sewer, which will not be impacted by this development proposal. The applicant is aware that encroachment into the SRW is not permitted. PH – 8\n",

(on behalf of Khalid Hasan of Pakland Qadri Gardens Ltd.) has applied to the City of Richmond for permission to rezone 7371 No. 4 Road from the \"Single Detached (RS1/F)\" zone to the \"Medium Density Townhouses (RTM2)\" zone, to permit the property to be developed for 19 townhouse units including two secondary suites, with vehicle access from General Currie Road. A location map and aerial photo of the subject site are provided in Attachment 1.\nFindings of Fact: A Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is provided in Attachment 2.\nExisting Site Condition and Context: A survey of the subject site is included in Attachment 3. The subject site is located on the northwest corner of the intersection of No. 4 Road and General Currie Road, and is currently accessed via No. 4 Road.\nSubject Site Existing Housing Profile: The subject site consists of a large lot containing a single-family dwelling that is occupied by a rental tenant. There are no secondary suites in the dwelling. The existing dwelling is proposed to be demolished at future development stage.\nSurrounding Development: Existing development immediately surrounding the subject site is as follows:\nTo the North: Is a large lot zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/F)\", containing a single-family dwelling, which fronts No. 4 Road, as well as a portion of a lot zoned \"Town Housing (ZT16) - South McLennan and St. Albans Sub-Area (City Centre)\" containing 22 townhouse units.\nTo the South: Immediately across General Currie Road, is a lot zoned \"Medium Density Townhouses (RTM3)\", containing 20 townhouse units.\nTo the East: Immediately across No. 4 Road, are large lots zoned \"Agriculture\" that are located in the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR), each of which contain single-family dwellings.\nTo the West: Are medium-sized lots zoned \"Single Detached (ZS14) - South McLennan (City Centre)\", each containing single-family dwellings fronting General Currie Road.\nPH - 184\nApril 17, 2023\n- 3 -\nRZ 20-919143 7183342\nExisting Legal Encumbrances: There is an existing Statutory Right-of-Way (SRW) registered on Title of the property for the sanitary sewer, water and drainage services along the front (east) property line. The applicant has been advised that encroachment into the SRW is not permitted. There is also a notation on Title of the property to indicate that the subject site may benefit from a cross-access easement registered on Title of the existing townhouse site further north at 7331 No. 4 Road. This notation is not relevant to this development proposal because vehicle access to the subject site is proposed directly off General Currie Road, which is the preferred scenario as it avoids vehicle access off No. 4 Road and is supported by the City's Transportation department. Should this rezoning application proceed, the cross-access easement registered on Title of 7331 No. 4 Road in favour of the subject site may be discharged at the request of the strata council of 7331 No. 4 Road.\nRelated Policies & Requirements\nOfficial Community Plan/McLennan South Sub-Area Plan\nLand Use Designations: The Official Community Plan (OCP) land use designation for the subject site is \"Neighbourhood Residential\". This redevelopment proposal is consistent with this designation. The McLennan South Sub-Area Plan land use designation for the subject site is \"Residential, 2 ½ storeys typical (3 storeys maximum), 0.55 base FAR\", and is identified as being in the \"C1 Character Area\", which is envisioned for clusters of housing contained predominantly in single, duplex, and triplex form and characterized by wooded areas (Attachments 4 & 5). The Sub-Area Plan allows for additional density to be considered where community benefits are provided (e.g., accessible housing beyond the typical provision; contribution to the child care reserve fund). This redevelopment proposal involving a density of 0.65 FAR is consistent with the Plan's land use designation for the subject site and character envisioned for this portion of the neighbourhood as it includes the retention of several trees on-site as well as the provision of four Convertible Units and two secondary suites. This proposal also provides road and pedestrian network improvements (including road dedication and a special crosswalk), and contributions to the Public Art Reserve Fund and Affordable Housing Reserve Fund.\nSite Size and Residual Lots: To encourage multi-family developments of sufficient size to support high quality development, the McLennan South Sub-Area Plan requires a minimum frontage width of 50 m along arterial roads and a minimum site area of 2,000 m2, and the creation of residual lots is avoided. Where a development proposal deviates from these requirements, it must be demonstrated that: access to the site is not off an arterial road and that future shared access to residual sites is enabled; the policy and design objectives of the Plan are not compromised; and the proposal provides a recognizable benefit to the area such as tree retention and enhanced pedestrian environment.\n",

Findings of Fact: A Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached. Subject Site Existing Housing Profile: There is an existing unoccupied single-family dwelling on the property with vehicle access from the rear lane, which is proposed to be demolished. The applicant has confirmed that there is no existing secondary suite in the dwelling. Surrounding Development: To the North: A single-family dwelling on a property zoned \"Compact Single Detached (RC1)\" fronting No. 1 Road.

Related Policies & Studies Official Community Plan/Seafair Planning Area: The subject property is located in the Seafair planning area and is designated \"Neighbourhood Residential\" in the Official Community Plan (OCP). The proposed rezoning and subdivision are consistent with this designation. PH – 44 April 17, 2023 - 3 - RZ 22-027435 7140712 Arterial Road Policy: The subject property is designated \"Arterial Road Compact Lot Single Detached\" on the Arterial Road Housing Development Map. The proposed rezoning is consistent with this Policy. Prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw, the applicant must submit a Landscape Plan, prepared by a Registered Landscape Architect, to the satisfaction of the Director, Development, and deposit a Landscaping Security based on 100 per cent of the cost estimate provided by the Landscape Architect, including installation costs. The Landscape Plan should comply with the guidelines of the OCP's Arterial Road Policy and include any required replacement trees identified as a condition of rezoning. Floodplain Management Implementation Strategy: The proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw. Public Consultation: A rezoning sign has been installed on the subject property. Staff have not received any comments from the public about the rezoning application in response to the early public notification or placement of the rezoning sign on the property. Should the Planning Committee endorse this application and Council grant first reading to the rezoning bylaw, the bylaw will be forwarded to a Public Hearing, where any area resident or interested party will have an opportunity to comment. Public notification for the Public Hearing will be provided as per the Local Government Act and the City's Zoning Bylaw 8500. Analysis: This redevelopment proposes to rezone and subdivide one existing single-family property into two new compact single-family lots with vehicular access from the rear lane. This rezoning and subdivision is consistent with the lot fabric and vehicular access of the adjacent lots on No. 1 Road. Similar applications to rezone and subdivide properties have been approved both to the north and south on the subject property along No. 1 Road. Existing Legal Encumbrances: None. Transportation and Site Access: Vehicular access to No. 1 Road is not permitted in accordance with Residential Lot (Vehicular) Access Bylaw No. 7222 and therefore will be restricted to the rear lane only.

The original Staff Report includes information on the site context, relevant City policies, public consultation prior to the original Planning Committee meeting, staff comments on-site planning, vehicle access, tree retention and replacement, site servicing and frontage improvements.\n\nAnalysis: Tree Retention and Replacement\nTree retention and replacement originally associated with this proposal was the result of an assessment by the project arborist and City review of 23 bylaw-sized trees on the subject site and 13 trees on neighbouring properties. The outcome of tree retention and replacement at that time was that four on-site trees (Trees # 364-367) and 13 trees on neighbouring properties (Trees #OS1-OS13) were to be retained together with an appropriate cash security and that 19 on-site trees were to be removed and replaced at a 2:1 ratio, consistent with the City’s Official Community Plan (OCP).\n\nThe current owner purchased the property in 2021 and has since made progress with several aspects of the proposal, including:\n- Installation of tree protection fencing around the four on-site trees and 13 neighbouring trees to be retained.\n- Obtaining a T3 Tree Removal Permit for the on-site trees identified for removal to facilitate site preparation following the Public Hearing, and submission of a tree replacement security in the amount of $27,000.00.\n- Advancing the design of the required servicing and off-site improvements through the Servicing Agreement review process.\n- Advancing the Development Permit (DP) application to the Development Permit Panel on September 14, 2022.\n\nWith the new information provided by the project arborist this year (Attachment A), it is understood that there has been an observed natural decline in the condition of the four on-site trees that were originally identified to be retained such that they are not expected to recover (Trees # 364-367). The applicant’s Certified Arborist and Tree Risk Assessor has confirmed that the decline in health is the result of natural factors which could not have been predicted nor detected under means of industry standards. On this basis, the applicant is seeking to remove these four trees and plant an additional eight trees on-site, consistent with the 2:1 replacement ratio in the OCP. Each of the eight additional trees to be planted on-site are equal to or greater than the minimum replacement size specified in the City’s Tree Protection Bylaw 8057. The $40,000.00 tree survival security originally associated with retention of the four on-site trees is no longer required, and the eight additional replacement trees will be accounted for in the landscaping security associated with the Landscape Plan that forms part of the Development Permit.\n\nA comparison between the original proposal and the revised proposal is provided as follows:\n\nOriginal Proposal:\n- # Trees to be retained: 4 on-site trees (# 364, 365, 366, 367) and the provision of a $40,000 survival security, 13 trees on neighbouring properties (#OS1-OS13)\n- # Trees identified for removal: 19 on-site trees (# 358-363 and 368-380)\n- Replacement Tree Sizes: Min. Caliper Deciduous Tree - 6 cm, Min. Height Coniferous Tree - 3.5 m\n- Replacement Trees: 36\n\nRevised Proposal:\n- # Trees to be retained: 13 trees on neighbouring properties (#OS1-OS13)\n- # Trees identified for removal: 23 on-site trees (#358-380)\n- Replacement Tree Sizes: Min. Caliper Deciduous Tree - 8 cm, Min. Height Coniferous Tree - 4.0 m\n- Replacement Trees: 44\n",

This is to allow the property to be subdivided into two single-family lots. Vehicle access to the west lot (proposed Lot 1) is proposed from Ash Street, while vehicle access to the eastern lot (Lot 2) is proposed from a new extension of Armstrong Street. The site currently has an existing single-family dwelling on the western portion, which will remain on proposed Lot 1. A site survey showing the proposed subdivision plan is included.\nFindings of Fact:\nA Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached.\nSubject Site Existing Housing Profile:\nThe existing single detached house is currently rented and does not contain a secondary suite. The existing tenants will remain in the dwelling following the rezoning and subdivision application.\nSurrounding Development:\nTo the North: A single-family dwelling zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/F)\" fronting onto Ash Street.\nTo the South: Two single-family lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS2/E)\" - one lot fronts onto Ash Street, while the other lot fronts onto Armstrong Street.\nTo the East: Across Armstrong Street, a single-family dwelling zoned \"Single Detached (ZS14) - South McLennan (City Centre)\" fronting onto Breden Avenue.\nTo the West: Across Ash Street, the City-owned Paulik Park.\nRelated Policies & Studies:\nOfficial Community Plan/City Centre Area Plan:\nThe Official Community Plan (OCP) land use designation for the subject property is \"Neighbourhood Residential\" (NRES). The City Centre Area - McLennan South Sub-Area Plan land use designation for the subject property is \"Residential, Historic Single Family\". The proposed rezoning and subdivision comply with these designations and lot configuration requirements.\nFloodplain Management Implementation Strategy:\nThe proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\nPublic Consultation:\nA rezoning sign has been installed on the subject property. No comments have been received from the public about the rezoning application in response to the placement of the rezoning sign. The adjacent property owner to the north at 7600 Ash Street has been contacted and has no specific objections to the rezoning application.\nAnalysis:\nProposed Rezoning and Subdivision:\nThe redevelopment proposes to rezone and subdivide the subject site into two single-family lots. The existing single-family dwelling on the western portion of the site will be retained (proposed Lot 1), and a new single detached house with a secondary suite will be constructed on the eastern portion of the site (proposed Lot 2). The existing dwelling meets all the requirements of the proposed zone upon rezoning and subdivision. This development proposal is consistent with the redevelopment along this block of Ash Street.\nTransportation and Site Access:\nVehicle access to the western lot (Lot 1) is proposed from Ash Street via the existing driveway location, while vehicle access to the eastern lot (Lot 2) is proposed from the new Armstrong Street.\n",

Wayne Craig Director, Development (604-247-4625) WC:ak Att. REPORT CONCURRENCE R OUTED TO: CONCURRENCE Transportation; CONCURRENCE OF GENERAL MANAGER PLN - 9 June 19, 2023 - 2 - RZ 21-941597 7234065 Staff Report Origin 1243059 BC Ltd. (Directors: Menghe Zhu and Zhe Yan Huang) has applied to the City of Richmond for permission to rezone 12120 No. 5 Road from the \"Agriculture (AG1)\" zone to the \"Light Industrial (IL)\" zone to permit the development of two multi-tenant industrial buildings for a total of 13 strata-titled units (Attachment 1). Temporary vehicle access will be from No. 5 Road and ultimate vehicle access from the rear lane to Rice Mill Road. Findings of Fact A Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached (Attachment 2). Surrounding Development The subject site fronts onto No. 5 Road and is currently vacant. To the North: A vacant lot zoned \"Agriculture (AG1)\", outside the Agriculture Land Reserve (ALR) and designated \"Industrial\" in the Official Community Plan (OCP). The property is part of an active rezoning application (RZ 22-005648) to rezone the property to \"Light Industrial (IL)\" to develop a two-storey industrial building with vehicle access from an extension to the existing rear lane. The rezoning application is currently under staff review and will be presented to Council for consideration via a separate staff report. To the South: A single-family house on a lot zoned \"Agriculture (AG1)\" outside of the Agriculture Land Reserve and designated \"Industrial\" in the OCP. To the East: A site containing the BC Ferries maintenance/operations harbour, split-zoned \"Agriculture (AG1)\" and \"Light Industrial (IL)\" and designated \"Industrial\" in the OCP. The property is part of an active rezoning and Development Permit application (RZ 18-824565 & DP18-824566) to rezone to a site-specific zone in order to upgrade the fleet maintenance operations. The rezoning application is current at 3rd reading, while the DP application is under staff review. To the West: Immediately across No. 5 Road are Machrina Way and sites zoned \"Industrial Business Park (IB1)\" with warehouses and light industrial buildings. Related Policies & Studies Official Community Plan The Official Community Plan (OCP) land use designation for the subject site is \"Industrial\". The proposed rezoning is consistent with this designation. The site is zoned \"Agriculture (AG1)\", but is not located within the ALR. PLN - 10 June 19, 2023 - 3 - RZ 21-941597 7234065 Floodplain Management Implementation Strategy The proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. The subject site is located in an area with a designated Flood Construction Level (FCL) of 2.9 m GSC. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw. Public Consultation A rezoning sign has been installed on the subject property. Staff have not received any comments from the public about the rezoning application in response to the rezoning sign on the property. Should the Planning Committee endorse this application and Council grants first reading to the rezoning bylaw, the public will have an opportunity to comment further on all of the proposed amendments at the Public Hearing. Public notification of the Public Hearing will be provided as per the Local Government Act and the City's Zoning Bylaw 8500. Analysis Built Form and Architectural Character The proposed light industrial development consists of two buildings in a North-South arrangement with a bridging element over the drive aisle access to No. 5 Road. The two buildings total approximately 4,266 m2 in light industrial space and 1,276 m2 in ancillary office space. The buildings front No. 5 Road and have a proposed setback of 3.28 m from No. 5 Road and proposed height of 11.6 m, complying with Zoning Bylaw 8500. Conceptual development plans are provided in Attachment 3. Landscaping including tree replacement planting within the front yard setback, in conjunction with required frontage upgrades along No. 5 Road (multi-use pathway and landscaped boulevard), will improve the pedestrian scale of the development. In order to meet the minimum Flood Construction Level (FCL) of 2.9 m GSC as required in the City's Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204, the elevation of the subject site will be increased, resulting in the need for a retaining wall along the perimeter of the site. Fencing along the south property line will be used to screen the retaining wall and industrial-related activities from the adjacent residential property and will be limited to a maximum height of 2.4 m as measured from the averaged finish site grade. Transportation and Site Access Vehicle access to the site will be provided at the rear through the continuation and dedication of an existing lane established from Rice Mill Road. This lane is ultimately intended to extend south to the City-owned road allowance south of 12200 No. 5 Road. The ability to connect the lane to Rice Mill Road is contingent on the redevelopment of the site directly to the north, which is the subject of a current rezoning application (RZ 22-005648).

LTD. (Director: Salidran Kaur Bhullar), has applied to the City of Richmond for permission to rezone 10111 & 10113 No. 5 Road from the \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\" zone to the \"Arterial Road Compact Two-Unit Dwellings (RCD)\" zone. This rezoning would permit the property to be subdivided to create three lots each containing a front-to-back duplex with vehicle access from the existing rear lane. A location map of the subject site is provided in Attachment 1.\nA Development Permit application is required prior to rezoning adoption to address the form and character of the proposed duplexes.\nFindings of Fact\nA Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is provided in Attachment 2.\nSubject Site Existing Housing Profile: The subject site consists of a single lot containing a strata-titled non-conforming two-unit dwelling. The existing Strata Plan NW424 must be discharged from the Title prior to subdivision. Both units in the two-unit dwelling are currently tenant-occupied. The applicant has indicated that the two-unit dwelling also contains an unauthorized secondary suite in each unit, which are both being rented out. The applicant has notified the tenants of the proposed development and has not received any concerns to date. The existing dwelling is proposed to be demolished.\nSurrounding Development: Existing development immediately surrounding the subject site is as follows: To the North: One single-family dwelling on property zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\". To the South: One single-family dwelling on property zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\". To the East: Across No. 5 Road, a temple on property zoned \"Agriculture (AG1)\" and \"Religious Assembly (ZIS7)\". To the West: Across the lane, a two-family dwelling on property zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\". The property is currently the subject of a rezoning application (RZ 22-010976) to create two single-family lots with access from Seabrook Crescent. The application is under staff review. This application will be the subject of a separate staff report.\nPLN - 13\nAugust 21, 2023\n- 3 -\nRZ 22-019002\n7255616\nRelated Policies & Studies\nOfficial Community Plan (OCP Designation): The Official Community Plan (OCP) Land Use Map designation for this property is \"Neighbourhood Residential\". The proposed rezoning and subdivision is consistent with this designation.\nArterial Road Policy: The subject site is identified as \"Arterial Road Compact Lot Duplex\" on the Arterial Road Housing Development Map. The proposed rezoning is consistent with this designation and complies with the \"Arterial Road Compact Lot Duplex Development Requirements\" under the Arterial Road Policy.\nLot Size Policy 5434: The subject site is located within the area governed by Single-Family Lot Size Policy 5434 (adopted by Council in 1990; amended in 1991 and 2006). This Policy permits rezoning and subdivision of lots along this section of No. 5 Road in accordance with compact lot single-family or coach house zoning (i.e. minimum width of 9.0 m with a maximum of two dwelling units per lot), provided that vehicle accesses are to be from rear lane only (Attachment 3). The Single-Family Lot Size Policy framework in general provides guidance with respect to the creation of new lots based on lot size and vehicle access. Lot Size Policy 5434 allows for the subdivision of the property to create new lots with the minimum lot width of 9 m, provided that vehicle access is from the rear lane only. This application will create three lots with vehicle access from the rear lane, consistent with the minimum subdivision standards in the Lot Size Policy. The OCP Arterial Road Land Use Policy provides direction on the use of the subject property for residential duplexes on the same size lots as permitted under Lot Size Policy 5434. Compact lot duplexes will result in the same number of dwelling units as achieved via a rezoning to coach houses. As such, the proposed rezoning is consistent with Lot Size Policy 5434.\nAgricultural Land Reserve (ALR) Buffer Zone: A landscape buffer is required along the No. 5 Road frontage of this site. The buffer is intended to mitigate land use conflicts between the residential uses on the subject site and any agricultural land uses on the east site, across from No. 5 Road. The applicant is proposing a 4.0 m wide ALR buffer on the site along the entire east property line (Attachment 4). In addition to the landscape buffer, a restrictive covenant will be registered on Title, indicating that the landscaping within the ALR buffer cannot be removed or modified without the City's approval. The covenant would also identify that the landscape planting is intended to be a buffer to mitigate the potential impacts of noise, dust, and odor generated from typical farm activities.\nPLN - 14\n",

Wayne Craig Director, Development (604-247-4625) WC:le Att. 6 REPORT CONCURRENCE R OUTED T O: C ONCURRENCE Affordable Housing ; C ONCURRENCE OF G ENERAL M ANAGER C OF G PLN – 3 October 3, 2023 - 2 - RZ 22-011063 7349947 Staff Report Origin Pati Yik of Kennon Construction has applied on behalf of the property owners, Thomas Mau Shing Ng, Ling Y Ha and Shui Ting Chua to the City of Richmond to rezone 10840 and 10860 Bonavista Gate from the “Two-Unit Dwellings (RD1)” zone to the “Single Detached (RS2/C)” zone in order to subdivide the existing duplex lot into two single-family lots, each with vehicle access from Bonavista Gate (Attachment 1). The proposed subdivision plan and site plan are provided in Attachment 2. Findings of Fact A Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached (Attachment 3). Subject Site Existing Housing Profile This site is currently occupied by an existing duplex (two-family) dwelling, which will be demolished prior to subdivision. The existing two-family dwelling is owner-occupied and does not contain any secondary suites. Surrounding Development Development immediately surrounding the site is as follows: To the North: An existing strata-titled duplex on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”. To the South: Existing single detached houses on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”. To the East: An existing strata-titled duplex on a lot zoned “Two-Unit Dwellings (RD1)”. To the West: Single family dwellings on lots zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)” across Bonavista Gate. Related Policies & Studies Official Community Plan/Steveston Area Plan The property is designated as Neighbourhood Residential in the Official Community Plan (OCP), and as Single Family in the Steveston Area Plan (Attachment 4). This proposal is consistent with both of those land use designations. Floodplain Management Implementation Strategy The proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw. PLN – 4 October 3, 2023 - 3 - RZ 22-011063 7349947 Public Consultation A rezoning sign has been installed on the subject property. Staff have not received any comments from the public about the rezoning application in response to the placement of the rezoning sign on the property. Should the Planning Committee endorse this application and Council grant first reading to the rezoning bylaw, the bylaw will be forwarded to a Public Hearing, where any area resident or interested party will have an opportunity to comment. Public notification for the Public Hearing will be provided as per the Local Government Act and the City’s Zoning Bylaw 8500. Analysis Proposed Rezoning and Subdivision The applicant is proposing to rezone the subject site and subdivide it into two single-family lots, each with a secondary suite, with access from Bonavista Gate. This development proposal is consistent with development in the area. The proposed subdivision plan and site plan are shown in Attachment 2. Staff worked with the applicant to modify the building envelope to enable retention of trees on site at the front and rear of the property. Existing Legal Encumbrances There is a 3.0 m wide Statutory Right-of-Way (SRW) in the backyard along the eastern property line for sanitary sewer utility purposes. The applicant has been advised that encroachment into the SRW is not permitted. A City Covenant is registered on both 10840 and 10860 Bonavista Gate Titles that restrict the development to a duplex, therefore, the duplex covenants must be discharged from Title prior to the final adoption of the rezoning bylaw. There is a Land Tax Deferment Act Agreement currently registered on the 10840 Bonavista Gate Title (proposed Lot A), which allows the property owner to defer the payment of taxes. All deferred taxes must be paid and the agreement must be discharged from Title prior to the preparation and registration of any legal documents associated with this rezoning application. Transportation and Site Access Vehicle access is proposed to be from Bonavista Gate for both of the proposed lots. The existing driveways will be removed and new driveways will be constructed as detailed in the Site Servicing and Frontage Improvements sub-section of this report. Two parking spaces will be provided for each dwelling unit in the garage. PLN – 5\n",

Subsection 6.4.9 identifies this as an “intensive employment area” with direction to encourage high-intensity employment uses, including office, institutional, and industrial uses. At-grade retail may be supported only in conjunction with high-intensity job uses. The Plan establishes building heights for up to 100 ft. and a density of up to 3.00 FSR. Employment Lands and Economy Review Phase 2 Report: Emerging Directions for Consideration Through Vancouver Plan (“ELER”) – The ELER was a research initiative and includes analysis of Vancouver’s economy, changes over time, and future projections. The report identifies directions to guide future planning and engagement in the Vancouver Plan process with quick start actions to intensify job space in key areas. Quick Start Action 6 (b) considers additional heights and densities, beyond the provisions of the Plan, for intensive-employment sites that provide 100% employment space. This application is seeking additional height and density in accordance with this policy and the MLPU. Marine Landing Policy Updates (“MLPU”) – The updates provide guidance to evaluate rezoning applications in the Marine Landing area. The document supplements the Plan with directions regarding built form, public realm, transportation, and public benefits. Strategic Analysis 1. Proposal The rezoning proposal would permit two mixed-employment buildings (one 11-storey (56.9 m (187 ft.)) and one 19-storey (79 m (259 ft.)) above a three-storey podium (see Figure 2, and additional drawings in Appendix F).\n",

The application meets the intent of the policy, and staff recommend referring it to a Public Hearing with the recommendation to approve, subject to conditions.\n\nCOUNCIL AUTHORITY/PREVIOUS DECISIONS\n- Vancouver Plan (2022)\n- Secured Rental Policy (2012, last amended 2022)\n- RR-2B District Schedule (2021)\n- Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines (2021)\n- Housing Needs Report (2022)\n- Family Room: Housing Mix Policy for Rezoning Projects (2016)\n- High-Density Housing for Families with Children Guidelines (1992)\n- Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy (2019)\n- Community Amenity Contributions Policy for Rezonings (1999, last amended 2022)\n- Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings (2010, last amended 2022)\n- Urban Forest Strategy (2014)\n\nREPORT\nBackground/Context\n1. Site and Context\nThe subject site is comprised of four legal parcels fronting East 33rd Avenue. The site area is approximately 2,460 sq. m (26,477 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 60 m (198 ft.) along East 33rd Avenue and a depth of 40 m (131 ft.) along the east property line.\n\n2. Policy Context\n- Vancouver Plan: A land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City.\n- Secured Rental Policy: Encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing.\n- The proposed rezoning aligns with the Secured Rental Policy and supports the increase in rental housing supply.\n\nNote: The document continues with additional information and details.\nMultiple conversion dwellings located near public transit and local shopping, on the first full block of an eligible arterial road, may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to new residential rental zones. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments off arterials. Up to six storeys may be considered for projects on arterials with below-market rental housing or social housing. This application complies with location criteria for six-storey buildings but is seeking five storeys without a below-market rental component.\n\nIn December 2021, Council approved the addition of three new residential rental zoning district schedules: RR-1, RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C, and RR-3A and RR-3B. The RR zones set regulations for use, density, and height limits, with all residential uses secured as rental tenure and no stratification or sale of individual units allowed. The Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines provide further direction on form of development expectations under each RR zone.\n\nThe Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027) and the 3 Year Action Plan (2018-2020) aim to shift the supply of housing options and address the housing needs of the city.\n",

The amendment would allow for a six-storey mixed-use rental building with 20% of the residential floor area as below-market rental units.

Site and Context\nThe subject site is comprised of two legal parcels fronting West 41st Avenue. The site area is approximately 1,646 sq. m (17,717 sq. ft.) with a frontage of 43.3 m (142 ft.) along West 41st Avenue and a depth of 38.1 m (125 ft.).\n2. Policy Context\n- Vancouver Plan: A land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City.\n- Secured Rental Policy: Encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing.\nThe SRP outlines locational eligibility criteria for rezoning in low-density areas.\nSites that meet the criteria are eligible for rezoning.\nThese criteria and that are part of the typical street grid (including having lane or secondary street access to the rear) and are regular in shape, size and other attributes may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the new residential rental zones. The applicable option or options are further informed by the site’s size, orientation and adjacent context. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under the SRP for six-storey buildings. RR Zoning District Schedules and Design Guidelines – Along with updates to the SRP, in December 2021 Council approved the addition of three new residential rental (“RR”) zoning district schedules to the Zoning and Development By-law: “RR-1”, “RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C”, and “RR-3A and RR-3B”. Like other standard zoning districts, the RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed. Further direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines. Recognizing that the SRP and RR zones are intended to enable incremental change in neighbourhoods that currently consist primarily of detached houses and duplexes, the guidelines support new missing middle buildings that foster neighbourliness and social connection, and contribute to an evolving streetscape which accommodates more architectural variety and diversity of housing options. Housing Vancouver Strategy – In November 2017, Council approved the Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027) and the 3 Year Action Plan (2018-2020). These seek to shift the supply of new homes toward the right supply, with targets for new units along a continuum of housing.\n",

It consists of two lots with existing duplexes. The surrounding neighborhood is primarily low-density residential.\nNeighborhood Amenities\n- Parks: Beaconsfield Park and John Hendry (Trout Lake) Park are nearby.\n- Community Centers: Italian Cultural Centre and Trout Lake Community Centre are nearby.\n- Transit: Nanaimo bus and Renfrew SkyTrain station are accessible.\n- Bicycle routes: Central Valley Bikeway and Sunrise bikeway are nearby.\nPolicy Context\n- Memorandum of Understanding (2020) (MoU) describes a partnership.\nThe Permanent Supportive Housing Initiative (PSHI) is delivering supportive housing on city-owned sites. The MoU was executed by BC Housing, the CMHC, and the City in 2020. Five projects are proceeding through this initiative to deliver a minimum of 300 new permanent, deeply affordable social housing units, with on-site and in-reach support services. Staff are prioritizing the processing and delivery of deeply affordable housing projects that leverage significant senior government investment to address housing inequity.\n\nThe Vancouver Plan, a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years, was approved by Council on July 22, 2022. The approved Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The site is located within the Renfrew Collingwood Community Vision. Implementation of the Vancouver Plan includes a review of all existing land use policies, including the Visions, to expand opportunities to address city-wide objectives. The proposal also addresses priorities within the Housing Vancouver Strategy, which aligns with the Vancouver Plan.\n\nThe Renfrew Collingwood Community Vision (2004) supports the provision of affordable housing for low-income households and urges senior governments to fund non-market housing. The Vision permits consideration of rezoning for social housing projects without further planning study.\n",

The Victoria-Fraserview/Killarney Community Vision (2002) supports rezoning for social housing projects and encourages more diverse housing types along Marine Drive. On April 27, 2022, Council resolved to receive a Housing Needs Report (HNR) prepared by staff. This zoning amendment would facilitate the delivery of social housing units and address the data and findings within the HNR. The Housing Vancouver Strategy seeks to shift the supply of new homes toward the right supply and identifies the need to coordinate action with senior governments, non-profit, and Indigenous housing partners. 72,000 new homes are targeted for the 10-year period from 2018 to 2027, including 4,100 social housing units with supports. This application would contribute 72 new housing units.\n",

Site and Context\nThe subject site at 817-837 West 28th Avenue and 4375 Willow Street is comprised of four legal parcels along 28th Avenue, west of Willow Street. The site area is approximately 2,344 sq. m (25,231 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 61.6 m (202.1 ft.) along 28th Avenue and a depth of 38.1 m (125.0 ft.). The current houses were constructed in 1944, 1945, and 2007 with tenants eligible for tenant protection.\nThe site and surrounding area are zoned RS-1, CD-1, or RM-8A. The RS-1 area is eligible for rezoning to RM-8A, for which a number of lots have been rezoned or contain an active rezoning application. Other uses in the area include Braemar Park and CD-1 districts for a community care facility, BC Women's and Children's Hospital, medical facilities, a synagogue, and a school.\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan - The Vancouver Plan is a long-term land use strategy approved by Council in 2022. The site is located within the Cambie Corridor Plan, which aligns with the Vancouver Plan.\nCambie Corridor Plan - The Plan guides the transformation of the Corridor into an area for residential and commercial development. The site is located within the Queen Elizabeth neighborhood of the Plan, which calls for new ground-oriented housing opportunities.\nDesign Guidelines - The RM-8A/AN District Schedule is accompanied by clear design guidelines that establish expectations for new buildings.\nFurther, the RM-8AN District requires noise mitigation measures for buildings located on\nbased solely on the compliance of the proposal with the regulations and guidelines set out in the\nDistrict Schedule.\n2.\nHousing Diversity and Affordability\nThe proposed rezoning to RM-8A/AN supports the City’s goals of increasing housing diversity\nand affordability. The RM-8A/AN District Schedule allows for a mix of housing types, including\nground-oriented townhouses and apartments, which can accommodate a range of household\nsizes and incomes. The proposed development will contribute to the City’s affordable housing\nsupply.\n3.\nTransit-Oriented Development\nThe site is located within close proximity to transit services, including bus routes and the future\nSkyTrain station. The proposed rezoning to RM-8A/AN encourages transit-oriented development\nby providing housing options near public transportation, reducing reliance on private vehicles,\nand promoting sustainable transportation choices.\n4.\nNeighbourhood Character\nThe proposed development is designed to respect and enhance the existing neighbourhood\ncharacter. The building design and landscaping will be sensitive to the surrounding context and\nwill contribute positively to the streetscape. The proposed development will also provide\nadequate setbacks and open spaces to maintain a comfortable and livable environment for\nresidents and the community.\n5.\nCommunity Amenities\nThe proposed development will include community amenities such as outdoor gathering spaces,\nlandscaped areas, and pedestrian connections. These amenities will enhance the quality of life\nfor residents and contribute to the overall livability of the neighbourhood.\n6.\nPublic Consultation\nThe rezoning application has undergone a comprehensive public consultation process. The\napplicant has engaged with the community through open houses, information sessions, and\nfeedback opportunities. The input received from the public has been considered and\nincorporated into the design and planning of the proposed development.\n7.\nSustainability and Green Building Design\nThe proposed development will incorporate sustainable design principles and green building\nfeatures. This includes energy-efficient building systems, water conservation measures, and\nlandscaping that promotes biodiversity. The development will contribute to the City’s\nenvironmental goals and support a more sustainable future.\n8.\nParking and Transportation\nThe proposed development will provide on-site parking for residents and visitors. The number of\nparking spaces will comply with the City’s parking requirements. Additionally, the site’s proximity\nto transit services encourages the use of public transportation and reduces the need for private\nvehicle ownership.\n9.\nServicing and Infrastructure\nThe proposed development will be serviced by existing infrastructure, including water, sewer, and\nstormwater systems. The necessary upgrades and connections will be made to ensure the\ndevelopment is adequately serviced and does not place undue strain on the existing\ninfrastructure.\n10.\nConstruction and Phasing\nThe proposed development will be constructed in phases to minimize disruption to the\nneighbourhood. Construction activities will be managed to mitigate noise, dust, and other\npotential impacts on the surrounding area. The phasing plan will be implemented to ensure a\nsmooth and efficient construction process.\n",

Site and Context\nCurrently zoned RM-3A, the subject site is located on the northwest corner of North Templeton Drive and Oxford Street. The two frontages are 30.2 m and 37.2 m, with a total site area of 1,123.1 sq. m. The properties consist of two buildings with 13 rental units. All 13 units are tenanted with six tenancies eligible for protections under the Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy.\nLocal School Capacity - The site is in the catchment area of Hastings Elementary School and Templeton Secondary School. The Vancouver School Board (VSB)'s 2020 Long Range Facilities Plan anticipates that Hastings Elementary and Templeton Secondary will both be operating under capacity by 2031, at 65% and 61% respectively.\nNeighbourhood Amenities - The following amenities are within close proximity: Parks - Oxford, Templeton, Trillium, and Trinity; Cultural/Community Spaces - Quest Food Exchange, Kiwassa Neighbourhood House Annex, and Templeton Pool; Childcare - Montessori & More Learning Centre and Harbourview Day Care.\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan - Approved by Council on July 22, 2022, the Vancouver Plan is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The site is located within the Grandview Woodland Community Plan which is generally in alignment with the Vancouver Plan.\nGrandview-Woodland Community Plan - The site is within the \"Residential Core\" character area of the \"Cedar Cove\" neighbourhood. This area is zoned RM-3A, consisting of purpose-built rental apartments.\nThe ODP requires existing rental housing to be maintained and allows for new rental housing to be introduced gradually. Subsection 6.3.1 of the Plan considers rezoning for 100% secured-rental housing in the Residential Core area, with a maximum of six storeys and an FSR of 2.4. The Plan aims to retain this area for affordable housing options, focusing on new rental housing surrounded by local shops, services, and improved public spaces. The Plan also established a \"pace of change\" policy to manage applications involving the demolition of protected market-rental housing. This policy limits redevelopment to five project sites or a maximum of 150 existing market-rental units in the first three years of the Plan. This project is one of the five eligible for redevelopment. Staff are currently renewing and updating the policy for Council's consideration later this year.\n",

Site and Context\nThe subject site is comprised of two legal parcels at the corner of West 45th Avenue and Granville Street. The total site area is approximately 2,273 sq. m (24,466 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 43.1 m (141 ft.) along Granville Street and a depth of 52.8 m (173 ft.).\n2. Policy Context\nThe Vancouver Plan, Secured Rental Policy, and other relevant policies support the rezoning of the site to RR-2B for the construction of a five-storey rental building.\nApplicable options or options are informed by site size, orientation, and adjacent context. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six-storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing.\n\nRR Zoning District Schedules and Design Guidelines - In December 2021, Council approved the addition of new residential rental (\"RR\") zoning district schedules to the Zoning & Development By-law; RR-1, RR-2A, RR-2B, and RR-2C, and RR-3A and RR-3B. The RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed.\n\nFurther direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines. The guidelines support new missing middle buildings that foster neighborliness and social connection, and contribute to an evolving streetscape which accommodates more architectural variety and diversity of housing options.\n\nHousing Vancouver Strategy - In November 2017, Council approved the Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027). These seek to shift the supply of new homes toward the right supply, with targets for new units along a continuum of housing types. The Housing Vancouver targets were based on the core goals of retaining the diversity of incomes and households in the city, shifting.\n",

The amendment would allow for a five-storey rental building in accordance with the Secured Rental Policy (“SRP”). A future building design would be submitted through the development permit process and reviewed with the public at that time. Staff have assessed the application and conclude that it meets the intent of the SRP. Staff recommend that the application be referred to a Public Hearing, with the recommendation of the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability to approve it in principle, subject to the Public Hearing, and conditions contained within Appendix B.\nCOUNCIL AUTHORITY/PREVIOUS DECISIONS\nRelevant Council policies for this site include:\n• Vancouver Plan (2022)\n• Secured Rental Policy (2012, last amended 2022)\n• RR-2B District Schedule (2021)\n• Housing Needs Report (2022)\n• Housing Vancouver Strategy (2017)\n• Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines (2021)\n• Family Room: Housing Mix Policy for Rezoning Projects (2016)\n• High-Density Housing for Families with Children Guidelines (1992, last amended 2020)\n• Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy (2019)\n• Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings (2010, last amended 2022)\n• Urban Forest Strategy (2014)\n• Latecomer Policy (2021)\n• Vancouver Development Cost Levy By-law No. 9755\n• Vancouver Utilities Development Cost Levy By-law No. 12183\nREPORT\nBackground/Context\n1. Site and Context\nThe subject site (see Figure 1) is comprised of three legal parcels fronting Granville Street. The total site area is approximately 2,371.7 sq. m (25,529 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 57 m (187 ft.) along Granville Street and a depth of 45.7 m (150 ft.).\nFigure 1: Location Map – Site and Context\nThis property and the surrounding area are zoned for residential uses under the RS District Schedules with the exception of the C-1 area to the north that allows mixed-use development with commercial and residential uses. The site is currently zoned RS-1 and developed with three single-detached homes all constructed in 1926. The properties are not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Registry. Only one of the properties has a rental tenancy, and the Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy does not apply.\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The approved Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The proposal addresses priorities within the Housing Vancouver Strategy which aligns with the Vancouver Plan.\nSecured Rental Policy (“SRP”) – The SRP encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing in Vancouver. Updates to the SRP were approved by Council in December 2021 to streamline the delivery of new rental housing. These included clarifying opportunities for rezoning in low-density areas close to public transit, shopping and other daily needs, and to streamline and simplify the rezoning process by utilizing new rental zones with standardized regulations. The SRP outlines the following locational eligibility criteria for sites in low-density areas:\n• In an existing RS or RT zone outside of recent community plan areas (excluding certain RT-zoned areas in Kitsilano and Kensington-Cedar Cottage with high proportions of heritage buildings and multiple conversion dwellings);\nLocated near public transit and local shopping, on the first full block of an eligible arterial road. Sites meeting these criteria, part of the typical street grid with access to the rear, and regular in shape, size, and attributes may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the new RR zones. The applicable option or options depend on the site's size, orientation, and adjacent context. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments off arterials. Up to six storeys may be considered for projects on arterials with a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. RR zoning district schedules and design guidelines were added to the Zoning & Development By-law in December 2021, including RR-1, RR-2A, RR-2B, RR-2C, RR-3A, and RR-3B. The RR zones have basic regulations for use, density, and height limits, with all residential uses secured as rental tenure and no stratification or sale of individual units allowed. The Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines provide further direction on development expectations for each RR zone, supporting new missing middle buildings that foster neighborliness, social connection, and architectural variety. The Housing Vancouver Strategy, approved in November 2017, aims to shift the supply of new homes towards a diverse range of housing types, retaining the diversity of incomes and households in the city.\n",

The site is zoned C-1 District and developed with an active gas station. Surrounding properties include a four-storey mixed-use building to the north and single detached houses to the east, south, and west. Rezonings for secured rental are permitted in the surrounding areas.\nNeighbourhood Amenities\n- Parks: Arbutus Greenway, Granville Park, Connaught Park, Angus Park, and Trafalgar Park\n- Community Spaces: Kitsilano Community Centre and Kitsilano Rink\n- Childcare Facilities: York House Little School, West Point Grey Day Care, Montessori Day Care, Arbutus-Ridge LIFT Early Learning Centre Inc., Maple Ranch Childcare Centre\nLocal School Capacity\n- Trafalgar Elementary School and Prince of Wales Secondary School are within the catchment area.

The SRP expands on Rental 100 by consolidating rezoning opportunities for secured rental housing previously in the Affordable Housing Choices Interim Rezoning Policy and introducing new green building requirements. Amendments to the SRP were adopted on December 14, 2021, allowing RS and RT zoned sites on arterials adjacent to large commercial areas to rezone to a new rental tenure district schedule.\n\nHousing Needs Report: On April 27, 2022, Council resolved to receive a Housing Needs Report (HNR) prepared by staff. Council must consider the most recent HNR when developing or amending a development plan in relation to affordable housing, rental housing, and special needs housing. This zoning amendment would facilitate the delivery of secured rental housing, including below market rental units, and address the data and findings within the HNR.\n",

The site is currently zoned RS-5 and developed with three single-detached homes all constructed in 1946. The properties are not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Registry. The property contains one rental tenancy and the Tenant Protection Policy applies.\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The approved Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The proposal addresses priorities within the Housing Vancouver Strategy which aligns with the Vancouver Plan.\nSecured Rental Policy (“SRP”) – The SRP encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing in Vancouver. Updates to the SRP were approved by Council in December 2021 to streamline the delivery of new rental housing. These included clarifying opportunities for rezoning in low-density areas close to public transit, shopping and other daily needs, and to streamline and simplify the rezoning process by utilizing new rental zones with standardized regulations. The SRP outlines the following locational eligibility criteria for sites in low-density areas: • In an existing RS or RT zone outside of recent community plan areas (excluding certain RT-zoned areas in Kitsilano and Kensington-Cedar Cottage with high proportions of heritage buildings and multiple conversion dwellings); and • Located within close proximity to public transit and local shopping; and • On the first full block on either side of an eligible arterial road. Sites that meet these criteria and that are part of the typical street grid (including having lane or secondary street access to the rear) and are regular in shape, size and other characteristics are eligible for rezoning under the SRP.\nAttributes may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the new RR zones. The applicable option or options are further informed by the site’s size, orientation, and adjacent context. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under SRP for five-storey buildings.\n\nRR Zoning District Schedules and Design Guidelines – Along with updates to the SRP, in December 2021 Council approved the addition of new residential rental (“RR”) zoning district schedules to the Zoning & Development By-law; RR-1, RR-2A, RR-2B, and RR-2C, and RR-3A and RR-3B. Like other standard zoning districts, the RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed. Further direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines.\n\nRecognizing that the SRP and RR zones are intended to enable incremental change in neighborhoods that currently consist primarily of detached houses and duplexes, the guidelines support new missing middle buildings that foster neighborliness and social connection, and contribute to an evolving streetscape which accommodates more architectural variety and diversity of housing options.\n\nHousing Vancouver Strategy – In November 2017, Council approved the Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027). These seek to shift the supply of new homes toward the right supply, with targets for new units along a continuum of housing types. The Housing Vancouver targets were based on the core goals of retaining the diversity of incomes and households in the city, shifting housing production towards rental to meet the greatest need, and coordinating action with government and non-profit partners to deliver housing for the lowest income households.\n",

The amendment would allow for a five-storey market rental building in accordance with the Secured Rental Policy (“SRP”). A future building design would be submitted through the development permit process and reviewed with the public at that time. Staff have assessed the application and conclude that it meets the intent of the SRP. Staff recommend that the application be referred to a Public Hearing, with the recommendation of the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability to approve it in principle, subject to the Public Hearing, and conditions contained within Appendix B.\nCOUNCIL AUTHORITY/PREVIOUS DECISIONS\n• Vancouver Plan (2022)\n• Secured Rental Policy (2012, last amended 2022)\n• RR-2B District Schedule (2021)\n• Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines (2021)\n• Housing Needs Report (2022)\n• Family Room: Housing Mix Policy for Rezoning Projects (2016)\n• High-Density Housing for Families with Children Guidelines (1992)\n• Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy (2019)\n• Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings (2010, last amended 2022)\n• Urban Forest Strategy (2014)\n• Latecomer Policy (2021)\n• Vancouver Development Cost Levy By-law No. 9755\n• Vancouver Utilities Development Cost Levy By-law No. 12183\nREPORT\nBackground/Context\n1. Site and Context\nThe subject site is comprised of four legal parcels fronting Arbutus Street. The site area is approximately 3,957.3 sq. m (42,596 sq. ft.). The rezoning site includes a portion of the east/west lane. Conditions for the sale of the lane to the applicant are contained in Appendix B.\nFigure 1: Location Map – Site and Context\nThis property and the surrounding area are zoned for residential uses under the RS District Schedule. The site is currently zoned RS-5 and developed with three single-detached homes constructed in 1922, 1925, and 1926. The properties are not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register. The property contains two rental tenancies and both are eligible under the Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy.\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The approved Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The proposal addresses priorities within the Housing Vancouver Strategy which aligns with the Vancouver Plan.\nSecured Rental Policy (“SRP”) – The SRP encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing in Vancouver. Updates to the SRP were approved by Council in December 2021 to streamline the delivery of new rental housing. These included clarifying opportunities for rezoning in low-density areas close to public transit, shopping and other daily needs, and to streamline and simplify the rezoning process by utilizing new rental zones with standardized regulations. The SRP outlines the following locational eligibility criteria for sites in low-density areas:\n• In an existing RS or RT zone outside of recent\nCommunity plan areas (excluding certain RT-zoned areas in Kitsilano and Kensington-Cedar Cottage with high proportions of heritage buildings and multiple conversion dwellings). Located within close proximity to public transit and local shopping. On the first full block on either side of an eligible arterial road. Sites that meet these criteria and that are part of the typical street grid (including having lane or secondary street access to the rear) and are regular in shape, size and other attributes may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the new RR zones. The applicable option or options are further informed by the site’s size, orientation and adjacent context. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six-storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under SRP for five-storey buildings. RR Zoning District Schedules and Design Guidelines – Along with updates to the SRP, in December 2021 Council approved the addition of new residential rental (“RR”) zoning district schedules to the Zoning & Development By-law: RR-1, RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C, and RR-3A and RR-3B. Like other standard zoning districts, the RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed. Further direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines. Recognizing that the SRP and RR zones are intended to enable incremental change in neighbourhoods that currently consist primarily of detached houses and duplexes, the guidelines support new missing middle buildings that foster neighbourliness and social connection, and contribute to an evolving streetscape which accommodates more architectural variety and diversity of housing options. Housing Vancouver Strategy – In November 2017, Council approved the Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027). The strategy seeks to shift the supply of new homes toward the right supply, with targets for new units along a continuum of housing types. The Housing Vancouver targets were based on the core goals of retaining the diversity of incomes and households in the community.\n",

    "text": "April 25, 2023, Yardley McNeill is the contact person with the phone number 604-873-7582. The RTS number is 15695 and the VanRIMS number is 08-2000-20. The meeting date is May 9, 2023. The recommendation is to refer the rezoning application for 3803-3823 West 10th Avenue to a Public Hearing. The recommendation is to approve the application in principle and to prepare the necessary by-law(s) for consideration at the Public Hearing. The application is to rezone the lands from RS-1 to RR-3B District. The recommendation is also to approve the draft zoning amendment by-law and the approvals are subject to the Conditions of Approval. The recommendation is to prepare a Housing Agreement By-law and to amend the Subdivision By-law. The recommendations are subject to certain conditions. The report recommends a plan amendment to rezone the site at 3803-3823 West 10th Avenue from RS-1 to RR-3B District. The amendment would allow for a six-storey mixed-use rental building with 20% of the residential floor area as below-market rental units. The application meets the intent of the Secured Rental Policy. The Council has made previous decisions related to this rezoning. The subject site is located at the corner of West 10th Avenue and Highbury Street. The site is currently zoned RS-1 and developed with three single-detached homes. The property contains three rental tenancies. The Vancouver Plan, Secured Rental Policy, and other policies are relevant to this rezoning.\nThe first full block on either side of an eligible arterial road may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the new RR zones. The applicable option or options are further informed by the site's size, orientation, and adjacent context. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under the SRP for six-storey buildings.\n\nIn December 2021, Council approved the addition of three new residential rental (\"RR\") zoning district schedules to the Zoning and Development By-law: RR-1, RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C, and RR-3A and RR-3B. The RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed.\n\nFurther direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines. The guidelines support new missing middle buildings that foster neighbourliness and social connection, and contribute to an evolving streetscape which accommodates more architectural variety and diversity of housing options. The RR-3B District Schedule permits mixed-use residential buildings up to six-storeys in height and 3.4 FSR, with a minimum 0.35 FSR of non-dwelling uses. Residential uses are permitted only on the second storey and above. Non-dwelling uses on the ground floor may include.\n",

Site and Context\nThe subject site is located on the north side of West 39th Avenue, between Alberta and Cambie Streets. It consists of a three-lot assembly with a total site area of 1,770 sq. m. The lots contain three single-detached houses.\nThe surrounding area is primarily residential and commercial. Nearby properties have redevelopment potential.\nNeighbourhood Amenities\n- Public Parks: Queen Elizabeth Park, Columbia Park, Van Dusen Botanical Garden, Oak Meadows Park, and Montgomery Park.\n- Cultural Spaces/Community Spaces: Oakridge Centre, youth centre at 5812 Cambie Street, and artist live-work space at 5910 Cambie Street.\n- Childcare: Garderie L'ile Aux Enfants, expanded childcare at the Jewish Community Centre, and new childcare facilities at Oakridge Centre and Oakridge Transit Centre.\nLocal School Capacity: The site is within the catchment area of Sir William Van Horne Elementary.\nSchool and Eric Hamber Secondary School will be operating under capacity in the coming years, with a utilization rate at 88% and 86% respectively, by 2029. The Vancouver Plan is a land-use strategy approved by Council on July 22, 2022 to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The site is located within the Cambie Corridor Plan, which is generally in alignment with the Vancouver Plan. The properties are located within the Oakridge Municipal Town Centre (MTC) neighbourhood of the Plan. Redevelopment is guided by Subsection 4.3.6, which anticipates high-density residential off arterial areas. Policies support opportunities for affordable housing with improved streetscapes, parks, shops, and services. Specifically, Section 4.3.6.1 allows for residential buildings up to 18 storeys with 100% secured-rental housing with 20% of residential floor area as below-market rental (BMR) having rental rates, unit eligibility requirements, and operating requirements in accordance with the City’s Moderate Income Rental Housing Program (2017). The Plan also permits a partial storey for an indoor rooftop amenity space that is contiguous with outdoor amenity space. On April 27, 2022, Council resolved to receive a Housing Needs Report prepared by staff. Council must consider the most recent housing needs report and the housing information on which the report is based when developing a development plan, or when amending a development plan in relation to housing policies of the Council respecting affordable housing, rental housing, and special needs housing. This application implements Council-approved direction on housing contained in the Plan, which is well supported by the data and findings in the Housing Needs Report.\n",

Site and Context\nThe subject site is comprised of one legal parcel on the northeast corner of East 40th Avenue and Quebec Street. The site area is approximately 2,653.9 sq. m (28,566 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 70.4 m (231 ft.) along East 40th Avenue and a depth of 37.2 m (122 ft.).\nThis property and the surrounding area are zoned for residential uses under RS and RT District Schedules with the exception of the CD-1 and C-2 areas to the southeast that allows mixed-use development with commercial and residential uses. The site is currently zoned RS-1 and developed with a church constructed in 1956. The property is not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register.\nThe property contains no rental tenancies and the tenant protection policy does not apply.\n\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan - The Vancouver Plan is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The approved Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The proposal addresses priorities within the Housing Vancouver Strategy which aligns with the Vancouver Plan.\nSecured Rental Policy (SRP) - The SRP encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing in Vancouver. Updates to the SRP were approved by Council in December 2021 to streamline the delivery of new rental housing. These included clarifying opportunities for rezoning in low-density areas close to public transit, shopping, and other daily needs, and to streamline and simplify the rezoning process by utilizing new rental zones with standardized regulations.\nThe SRP outlines locational eligibility criteria for sites in low-density areas, including being in an existing RS or RT zone outside of recent community plan areas, located within close proximity to public transit and local shopping, and on the first full block on either side of an eligible arterial road.\nThe SRP allows for rezoning of regular-shaped sites to new residential rental zones based on size, orientation, and adjacent context. It supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Projects on arterials may go up to six-storeys if they include below-market rental housing or social housing. This application complies with the criteria for off-arterial four-storey mixed-use buildings under the SRP.\n\nIn December 2021, Council added new residential rental zoning district schedules (RR-1, RR-2A, RR-2B, RR-2C, RR-3A, and RR-3B) to the Zoning & Development By-law. These zones have regulations for permitted use, density, and height limits, and all residential uses are secured as rental tenure with no stratification or sale of individual units allowed. The Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines provide further direction on development expectations for each RR zone.\n\nThe Housing Vancouver Strategy, approved in November 2017, aims to shift the supply of new homes towards rental housing. The strategy targets 72,000 new homes over 10 years, including 12,000 social, supportive, and non-profit co-operative units, and 20,000 purpose-built rental units. The goal is to retain income and household diversity, prioritize rental housing, and collaborate with government and non-profit partners to provide housing for low-income households. 50% of the new units are for households earning less than $80,000 per year, and 40% are family-size units.\n",

The development potential for each site falls within, below, or above this range based on site-specific urban design and public realm performance. Buildings are expected to have front doors to the street and activate adjacent lanes. The Plan also allows for consideration of an additional partial storey for common rooftop indoor amenity spaces if contiguous with the outdoor amenity space.\n\n3. On April 27, 2022, Council resolved to receive a Housing Needs Report (HNR) prepared by staff. The HNR is required by the BC Provincial government and must be considered by Council when developing or amending a development plan in relation to affordable housing, rental housing, and special needs housing.\n",

REPORT: Background/Context. 1. Site and Context. The subject site (see Figure 1) is comprised of one legal parcel fronting Hull Street. The total site area is approximately 396.8 sq. m (4,271 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 10.7 m (35 ft.) along Hull Street and a depth of 37.2 m (122 ft.). Figure 1: Location Map – Site and Context. The surrounding area includes properties zoned for single and multiple dwelling uses under RS and RT District Schedules. In addition, there are a number of CD-1 zones that allow for a variety of uses including seniors supportive housing and mixed-use developments with commercial and residential uses. The site is currently zoned RS-1 and developed with one single-detached home constructed in 1918. The property is not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register. The property contains two rental tenancies and the tenant protection policy does not apply. 2. Policy Context. Vancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The approved Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The proposal addresses priorities within the Housing Vancouver Strategy which aligns with the Vancouver Plan. Secured Rental Policy (“SRP”) – The SRP encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing in Vancouver. Updates to the SRP were approved by Council in December 2021 to streamline the delivery of new rental housing. These included clarifying opportunities for rezoning in low-density areas close to public transit, shopping and other daily needs, and to streamline and simplify the rezoning process by utilizing new rental zones with standardized regulations. The SRP outlines the following locational eligibility criteria for sites in low-density areas: • In an existing RS or RT zone outside of recent community plan areas (excluding certain RT-zoned areas in Kitsilano and Kensington-Cedar Cottage with high proportions of heritage buildings and multiple conversion dwellings); • Located within close proximity to public transit and local shopping; and • On the first full block on either side of an eligible arterial road. Sites that meet these criteria and that are part of the typical street grid (including having lane or secondary street access to the rear) and are regular in shape and size are eligible for rezoning to an RR District.\nshape, size, and other attributes may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to new residential rental zones. The applicable options are determined by the site's size, orientation, and adjacent context. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six-storeys may be considered for projects on arterials with a minimum 20% below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria for three-storey buildings under SRP.\n\nIn December 2021, Council approved the addition of new residential rental (\"RR\") zoning district schedules to the Zoning & Development By-law: \"RR-1\", \"RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C\", and \"RR-3A and RR-3B\". The RR zones set regulations for permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed. Further direction on development expectations under each RR zone is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines.\n\nThe SRP and RR zones aim to enable incremental change in neighborhoods with detached houses and duplexes. The guidelines support new missing middle buildings that foster neighborliness, social connection, and contribute to an evolving streetscape with architectural variety and diverse housing options.\n\nIn November 2017, Council approved the Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027). The strategy aims to shift the supply of new homes towards the right supply, with targets for new units across a continuum of housing types. The targets focus on retaining income and household diversity, increasing rental housing production, and coordinating with government and non-profit partners to provide housing for low-income households. The strategy aims for a total of 72,000 new homes in the 10-year period, including 12,000 social, supportive, and non-profit co-operative units, and 20,000 purpose-built rental units. Nearly 50% of the new homes are targeted for rental housing.\n",

The amendment would allow for a four storey rental building in accordance with the Secured Rental Policy (“SRP”). A future building design would be submitted through the development permit process and reviewed with the public at that time. Staff have assessed the application and conclude that it meets the intent of the SRP. Staff recommend that the application be referred to a Public Hearing, with the recommendation of the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability to approve it in principle, subject to the Public Hearing, and conditions contained within Appendix B.\nCOUNCIL AUTHORITY/PREVIOUS DECISIONS\n• Vancouver Plan (2022)\n• Secured Rental Policy (2012, last amended 2023)\n• RR-2A District Schedule (2022)\n• Residential Rental District Schedules Design Guidelines (2022)\n• Housing Needs Report (2022)\n• Family Room: Housing Mix Policy for Rezoning Projects (2016)\n• High-Density Housing for Families with Children Guidelines (1992, last amended 2022)\n• Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings (2010, last amended 2022)\n• Urban Forest Strategy (2014, last amended 2018)\n• Vancouver Development Cost Levy By-law No. 9755\n• Vancouver Utilities Development Cost Levy By-law No. 12183\nREPORT\nBackground/Context\n1. Site and Context\nThe subject site (see Figure 1) is comprised of a single legal parcel fronting West 30th Avenue. The total site area is approximately 1,204.8 sq. m (12,968 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 30.5 m (100 ft.) along West 30th Avenue and a depth of 39.5 m (130 ft.).\nFigure 1: Location Map – Site and Context\nThis property and the surrounding area are zoned for residential uses under RS District Schedules with the exception of the C-2 area to the west that allows mixed-use development with commercial and residential uses. The site is currently zoned RS-5 and is being used as a surface parking lot. The property contains no rental tenancies and the tenant protection policy does not apply.\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The approved Rezoning: 3581 West 30th Avenue – RTS 15780\nVancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The proposal addresses priorities within the Housing Vancouver Strategy which aligns with the Vancouver Plan.\nSecured Rental Policy (“SRP”) – The SRP encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing in Vancouver. Updates to the SRP were approved by Council in December 2021 to streamline the delivery of new rental housing. These included clarifying opportunities for rezoning in low-density areas close to public transit, shopping and other daily needs, and to streamline and simplify the rezoning process by utilizing new rental zones with standardized regulations.\nThe SRP outlines the following locational eligibility criteria for sites in low-density areas:\n• In an existing RS or RT zone outside of recent community plan areas (excluding certain RT-zoned areas in Kitsilano and Kensington-Cedar Cottage with high proportions of heritage buildings and multiple conversion dwellings);\n• Located within close proximity to public transit and local shopping; and\n• On the first full block on either side of an eligible arterial road.\nSites that meet these criteria and that are part of the typical street grid (including having lane or secondary street access to the rear) and are regular in shape, size and other attributes may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the new residential rental zones. The applicable option or\nOptions are further informed by the site’s size, orientation, and adjacent context. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six-storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under SRP for four storey buildings.\n\nRR Zoning District Schedules and Design Guidelines – Along with updates to the SRP, in December 2021 Council approved the addition of new residential rental (“RR”) zoning district schedules to the Zoning & Development By-law: RR-1, RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C, and RR-3A and RR-3B. Like other standard zoning districts, the RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed.\n\nFurther direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines. Recognizing that the SRP and RR zones are intended to enable incremental change in neighborhoods that currently consist primarily of detached houses and duplexes, the guidelines support new missing middle buildings that foster neighborliness and social connection, and contribute to an evolving streetscape which accommodates more architectural variety and diversity of housing options.\n\nHousing Vancouver Strategy – In November 2017, Council approved the Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027). The Strategy seeks to shift the supply of new homes toward the right supply, with targets for new units along a continuum of housing types. The Housing Vancouver targets were based on the core goals of retaining the diversity of incomes and households in the city, shifting housing production towards rental to meet the greatest need, and coordinating action with government and non-profit partners to deliver housing for the lowest income households.\n",

Site and Context\nThe subject site (see Figure 1) is comprised of six legal parcels fronting East 41st Avenue. The total site area is approximately 4,515.1 sq. m (48,600 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 91 m (300 ft.) along East 41st Avenue and a depth of 49 m (162 ft.).\nFigure 1: Location Map – Site and Context\nThis property and the surrounding area are zoned for residential uses under RS and RT-11 Schedules. There is a residential property zoned CD-1 directly east of the proposed site. The site is currently zoned RS-1 and developed with six single-detached homes constructed between 1970 and 1986. The properties are not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register. The property contains six rental tenancies and the Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy applies.\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The approved Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The proposal addresses priorities within the Housing Vancouver Strategy which aligns with the Vancouver Plan.\nSecured Rental Policy (“SRP”) – The SRP encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing in Vancouver. Updates to the SRP were approved by Council in December 2021 to streamline the delivery of new rental housing. These included clarifying opportunities for rezoning in low-density areas close to public transit, shopping and other daily needs, and to streamline and simplify the rezoning process by utilizing new rental zones with standardized regulations. The SRP outlines the following locational eligibility criteria for sites in low-density areas:\n• In an existing RS or RT zone outside of recent community plan areas (excluding certain RT-zoned areas in Kitsilano and Kensington-Cedar Cottage with high proportions of heritage buildings and multiple conversion dwellings);\n• Located within close proximity to public transit and local shopping; and\n• On the first full block on either side of an eligible arterial.\nRoads that meet certain criteria and are part of the street grid can be considered for rezoning under the SRP to new residential rental zones. The specific options depend on the size, orientation, and context of the site. The SRP generally allows for up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on non-arterial sites. Projects on arterials may be considered for up to six-storeys if they include below-market rental housing or social housing. This application complies with the location criteria for five-storey buildings under the SRP. In addition to the SRP, new residential rental zoning district schedules (RR-1, RR-2A, RR-2B, RR-2C, RR-3A, and RR-3B) were approved in December 2021. These zones have regulations regarding use, density, and height limits, and all residential uses are secured as rental tenure with no stratification or sale of individual units allowed. The Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines provide further direction on development expectations for each RR zone. The guidelines aim to support new buildings that promote neighborliness, social connection, and architectural variety in neighborhoods primarily consisting of detached houses and duplexes. The Housing Vancouver Strategy, approved in November 2017, aims to increase the supply of new homes.\n",

The proposal is to permit a four-storey and a three-storey residential building with 13 secured rental units. Staff recommend referring the application to a Public Hearing with the recommendation to approve it in principle, subject to conditions.\nCOUNCIL AUTHORITY/PREVIOUS DECISIONS\n• Vancouver Plan (2022)\n• Broadway Plan (2022)\n• Policy on Consideration of Rezoning Applications and Heritage Revitalization Agreements during Broadway Planning Process (Broadway Interim Rezoning Policy) (2018)\n• Secured Rental Policy (2012, last amended 2023)\n• Housing Needs Report (2022)\n• Housing Vancouver Strategy (2017)\n• Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy (2019, amended 2023)\n• Family Room: Housing Mix Policy for Rezoning Projects (2016)\n• High-Density Housing for Families with Children Guidelines (1992, last amended 2022)\n• Latecomer Policy (2021)\n• Vancouver Development Cost Levy By-law No. 9755\n• Vancouver Utilities Development Cost Levy By-law No. 12183\n• Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings (2010, amended 2022)\n• Urban Forest Strategy (2016)\nREPORT\nBackground/Context\nSite and Context\nThe subject site is located midblock on West 16th Avenue between Yukon and Alberta Streets. The site area is approximately 597.6 sq. m (6,432 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 15.2 m (50 ft.) along 16th Avenue and a depth of 39.3 m (129 ft.).\nThis property and the surrounding area are zoned for residential uses under the RT-5 District. The site is developed with a previously converted single-family residential dwelling with four rental units. Surrounding properties are developed with two-storey residential buildings.\nNeighbourhood Amenities\n- Public Parks: Lilian To, Mount Pleasant, Heather, Douglas, and Grimmett.\n- Community Spaces: Heritage Hall and Douglas Park Community Centre.\n- Childcare Facilities: Our House, Les Petits Artistes Montessori Centre, Cambie Montessori, and Acorn-Eight Oaks.\nLocal School Capacity\n- The site is located within the catchment area of Fraser Elementary School and Hamber Secondary School. Fraser Elementary is currently operating at 190% of capacity and is forecasted to be operating at 176% capacity by 2031. Hamber Secondary is operating under capacity with an expected capacity of 79% by 2031.\nPolicy Context\nVancouver Plan - The Vancouver Plan is a land use strategy approved by Council to guide long-term growth. The site is located within the Broadway Plan.\nBroadway Plan - The Broadway Plan is in alignment with the Vancouver Plan.\n\nThe Council approved a comprehensive community plan for the area from Vine Street to Clark Drive and 1st Avenue to 16th Avenue on June 22, 2022. The plan focuses on integrating new housing, jobs, and amenities around the new Broadway Subway. This application was submitted before the plan was approved but is being considered under the Broadway Plan.\n\nIn 2018, the Council endorsed the Broadway Interim Rezoning Policy, which allowed specific rezoning proposals to proceed during the planning process for the Broadway Plan. This application applied and qualified under this provision, along with the Secured Rental Policy.\n\nOn November 26, 2019, the Council approved amendments to the Secured Market Rental Housing Policy, renaming it the Secured Rental Policy. Further amendments were adopted on December 14, 2021, to facilitate the delivery of secured rental units. These changes allow certain sites on arterials adjacent to large commercial areas to rezone to a new rental tenure district schedule.\n\nThis application met the deadlines to be considered under the 2019 Secured Rental Policy but does not comply with the current policy as the site is now located in a community plan area.\n",

The rezoning would allow for a four-storey rental building in accordance with the Secured Rental Policy. Staff recommend referring the application to a Public Hearing with the recommendation to approve it in principle, subject to conditions.\nCOUNCIL AUTHORITY/PREVIOUS DECISIONS\n- Vancouver Plan (2022)\n- Secured Rental Policy (2012, last amended 2023)\n- RR-2A District Schedule (2022)\n- Residential Rental District Schedules Design Guidelines (2022)\n- Housing Needs Report (2022)\n- Family Room: Housing Mix Policy for Rezoning Projects (2016)\n- High-Density Housing for Families with Children Guidelines (1992, last amended 2022)\n- Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy (2019)\n- Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings (2010, last amended 2022)\n- Urban Forest Strategy (2014, amended 2018)\n- Vancouver Development Cost Levy By-law No. 9755\n- Vancouver Utilities Development Cost Levy By-law No. 12183\nREPORT\nBackground/Context\n1. Site and Context\nThe subject site is comprised of two legal parcels on Trafalgar Street. The total site area is approximately 882.4 sq. m (9,498 sq. ft.) with a frontage of 38.2 m (125 ft.) and a depth of 23.1 m (76 ft.).\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan - A long-term land use strategy approved by Council in 2022.\nSecured Rental Policy - Encourages the construction of new rental housing in Vancouver.\n\nThe applicable option or options are further informed by the site’s size, orientation, and adjacent context. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under SRP for four-storey buildings.\n\nRR Zoning District Schedules and Design Guidelines – Along with updates to the SRP, in December 2021 Council approved the addition of new residential rental (“RR”) zoning district schedules to the Zoning & Development By-law: “RR-1”, “RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C”, and “RR-3A and RR-3B”. Like other standard zoning districts, the RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed. Further direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines.\n\nRecognizing that the SRP and RR zones are intended to enable incremental change in neighborhoods that currently consist primarily of detached houses and duplexes, the guidelines support new missing middle buildings that foster neighborliness and social connection, and contribute to an evolving streetscape which accommodates more architectural variety and diversity of housing options.\n\nHousing Vancouver Strategy – In November 2017, Council approved the Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027). The strategy seeks to shift the supply of new homes toward the right.\n",

The proposed amendment would rezone the properties from RS-1 (Residential) District to RM-8A (Residential) District to allow for a townhouse or rowhouse development. The maximum floor space ratio (FSR) for RM-8A can be up to 1.20. The application meets the intent of the Cambie Corridor Plan. Staff recommend that the application be referred to a Public Hearing, with the recommendation of the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability to approve it in principle, subject to the Public Hearing, and conditions contained within Appendix B.\n\nCOUNCIL AUTHORITY/PREVIOUS DECISIONS\n• Vancouver Plan (2022)\n• Cambie Corridor Plan and Cambie Corridor Public Realm Plan (2018)\n• RM-8, RM-8A, RM-8N and RM-8AN Districts Schedule (2018, amended 2023)\n• RM-8A and RM-8AN Guidelines (2018, amended 2023)\n• Housing Needs Report (2022)\n• Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy (2019, amended 2023)\n• Density Bonus Contributions (2014, amended 2023)\n• Vancouver Utilities Development Cost Levy By-law No. 12183\n• Development Cost Levy By-law No. 9755\n• Latecomer Policy (2021)\n• Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings (2010, amended 2022)\n• Urban Forest Strategy (2014)\n\nREPORT\nBackground/Context\n1. Site and Context\nThe subject site at 6333-6369 Yukon Street is comprised of three legal parcels with single dwellings along Yukon Street, one block east of Cambie Street, between West 46th Avenue and West 48th Avenue. The site area is approximately 2,298 sq. m (24,736 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 49.4 m (162 ft.) along Yukon Street and a depth of 46.9 m (154 ft.).\nThe site and surrounding areas to the north, east and south are zoned RS-1 and the site is developed with three single-detached homes. To the west of the site, along Cambie Street, is a mixture of CD-1, RT-1 and RT-2 developments. The site is eligible for rezoning to RM-8A under the Cambie Corridor Plan. The Langara 49th Avenue Canada Line Station is one block away and Tisdall Park and the 45th Avenue Bikeway are approximately two blocks away.\nThe houses were constructed in 1950 and 1989 and are not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register. The property contains two rental tenancies and tenant protection applies.\n\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The approved Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The site is located within the Cambie Corridor Plan which is generally in alignment with the Vancouver Plan.\nCambie Corridor Plan (“the Plan”) – The Plan guides the transformation of the Corridor into an area where people can live, work, shop, play and learn – all within close proximity to the Canada Line. The Corridor’s population is anticipated to double by 2041, with 30,000 new homes, making it one of the largest growth areas outside of downtown.\nThe Plan identifies over 1,100 detached lots as eligible to redevelop for townhouses, creating opportunities for approximately 8,200 units of much-needed ground-oriented housing. Specifically, Section 4.3.12 of the Plan supports residential townhouses or rowhouses for up to three storeys and a maximum density of 1.20 FSR. The City has recently approved a second phase of City-initiated rezoning to RM-8A within the Cambie Corridor, however this site is not included within that area and requires a simplified rezoning to RM-8A.\nThe site is located within the Oakridge neighbourhood, which is a regionally designated Municipal Town Centre. This area is expected to evolve over time to become an urban hub with increased residential density, job space and shops and services to support an active street life. For off-arterial locations, which includes the subject site, a variety of new housing types and tenures are expected to allow more people to live in this area. The intent for this neighbourhood is to introduce family-friendly, ground-oriented housing in the form of townhouses or rowhouses. This will provide needed housing options.\nTransitions from taller buildings on Cambie Street to adjacent lower-density areas are guided by clear design guidelines. These guidelines establish expectations for development form, typologies, family housing requirements, sunlight access, privacy, landscape treatment, and flexible options for smaller lots. See Figure 2 for the form of development according to the design guidelines, which include courtyard rowhouses on the left and multiple unit stacked townhouses on the right.\n",

Up to six storeys may be considered for projects on arterials with a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under SRP for six-storey buildings. RR zoning district schedules (RR-1, RR-2A, RR-2B, RR-2C, RR-3A, and RR-3B) were added to the Zoning & Development By-law in December 2021. RR zones set regulations for permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed. Further direction on form of development expectations under each RR zone is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines.\n",

The proposed amendment would rezone the properties from RS-5 (Residential) District to RM-8AN (Residential) District to allow for a townhouse or rowhouse development. The maximum floor space ratio (FSR) for RM-8AN is 1.20 and can generate approximately six to eight townhouse units on one 50 ft.-wide lot.\nThe application meets the intent of the Cambie Corridor Plan (the “Plan”). Staff recommend that the application be referred to a Public Hearing, with the recommendation of the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability to approve it in principle, subject to the Public Hearing, and conditions contained within Appendix B.\nCOUNCIL AUTHORITY/PREVIOUS DECISIONS\n• Vancouver Plan (2022)\n• Cambie Corridor Plan and Cambie Corridor Public Realm Plan (2018)\n• RM-8, RM-8A, RM-8N and RM-8AN Districts Schedule and Guidelines (2018, amended 2023)\n• Housing Needs Report (2022)\n• Density Bonus Contributions (2014, amended 2023)\n• Vancouver Development Cost Levy By-Law No. 9755\n• Utilities Development Cost Levy By-law No. 12183\n• Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings (2010, amended 2022)\n• Latecomer Policy (2021)\n• Urban Forest Strategy (2014)\nRezoning: 4721 Oak Street – RTS 15910\nREPORT\nBackground/Context\n1. Site and Context\nThe subject site at 4721 Oak Street (see Figure 1) is comprised of one legal parcel along Oak Street, south of Connaught Drive. The site area is approximately 553.5 sq. m (5,958 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 15.1 m (49.7 ft.) along Oak Street and a depth of 37.6 m (120 ft.).\nThe surrounding areas are zoned RS-5 and RS-1 and developed with single-detached homes. BC Children’s Hospital, zoned CD-1, is northwest of the site. The area along Oak Street is eligible for rezoning to RM-8AN under the Plan.\nThe site contains one house, constructed in 1926 and is not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register. The property contains no rental tenancies and tenant protection does not apply.\nFigure 1: Location Map – Site and Context\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land-use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The site is located within the Plan which is in alignment with the Vancouver Plan.\nCambie Corridor Plan – The Plan guides the transformation of the Corridor into an area where people can live, work, shop, play and learn – all within close proximity to the Canada Line. The Corridor’s population is anticipated to double by 2041, with 30,000 new homes, making it one of the largest growth areas outside of downtown. The subject site is located within the Queen Elizabeth neighbourhood, characterized by its existing low-density residential character and green park-like setting.\nThe Plan identifies over 1,100 detached lots as eligible to redevelop for townhouses, creating opportunities for approximately 8,200 units of much-needed ground-oriented housing. Specifically, Section 4.2.9 of the Plan supports residential townhouses or rowhouses for up to three storeys and a maximum density of 1.20 FSR.\nDesign Guidelines – The RM-8A/AN District Schedules are accompanied by clear design guidelines. These guidelines establish form of development expectations which provide predictability and certainty for new buildings. Design criteria sets out expected typologies, requirements for family housing, access to sunlight, privacy, landscape treatment, along with flexible development options for smaller lots (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2: Form of Development per the Design Guidelines – (Courtyard Rowhouses (Left) and Multiple Unit Stacked Townhouses (Right)\nFurther, the RM-8AN District requires more robust noise mitigation measures for buildings that are located along arterial streets, whereas the RM-8A does not, since RM-8A sites are not facing arterials. Since 49th Avenue is classified as an arterial street, the proposed rezoning is to the RM-8AN District Schedule.\nHousing Needs Report (2022) – On April 27, 2022, Council resolved at a public meeting to receive a Housing Needs Report (HNR) prepared by staff. Further to the BC Provincial government’s requirement, Council must consider the most recent HNR when making decisions on housing policies and projects. The HNR provides an analysis of the City’s housing needs and identifies strategies to address those needs. The HNR supports the proposed rezoning as it contributes to the City’s housing supply and diversity.\nRECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended that the rezoning application for 4721 Oak Street be referred to a Public Hearing, with the recommendation of the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability to approve it in principle, subject to the Public Hearing, and conditions contained within Appendix B.\nDeveloping a development plan or amending a development plan in relation to Council's housing policies for affordable housing, rental housing, and special needs housing. This zoning amendment would facilitate the delivery of strata housing and is supported by data and findings within the HNR. The rezoning process to an RM-8A/AN follows a simplified process. Architectural drawings are not required at the rezoning stage, and the review is limited to a plan amendment to designate the site from RS-5 to RM-AN.\n",

The amendment would allow for a five-storey rental building in accordance with the Secured Rental Policy (“SRP”). An estimated total of 30 secured rental units would be delivered through this application. A future building design would be submitted through the development permit process and reviewed with the public at that time. Staff have assessed the application and conclude that it meets the intent of the SRP. Staff recommend that the application be referred to a Public Hearing, with the recommendation of the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability to approve it in principle, subject to the Public Hearing, and conditions contained within Appendix B.\nCOUNCIL AUTHORITY/PREVIOUS DECISIONS\n• Vancouver Plan (2022)\n• Secured Rental Policy (2012, last amended 2023)\n• RR-2B District Schedule (2022)\n• Residential Rental District Schedules Design Guidelines (2022)\n• Housing Needs Report (2022)\n• Family Room: Housing Mix Policy for Rezoning Projects (2016)\n• High-Density Housing for Families with Children Guidelines (1992, last amended 2022)\n• Urban Forest Strategy (2014, amended 2018)\n• Latecomer Policy (2021)\n• Vancouver Development Cost Levy By-law No. 9755\n• Vancouver Utilities Development Cost Levy By-law No. 12183\nREPORT\nBackground/Context\n1. Site and Context\nThe subject site (see Figure 1) is comprised of one legal parcel fronting Dunbar Street. The total site area is approximately 1,002.8 sq. m (10,800 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 24.4 m (80 ft.) along Dunbar Street and a depth of 41.1 m (135 ft.).\nFigure 1: Location Map – Site and Context\nThis property and the surrounding area are zoned for residential uses under RS District Schedules with a CD-1 directly adjacent that is being used for residential rental purposes. There is a pedestrian path directly north of the site connecting Dunbar Street and Collingwood Place. The site is currently zoned RS-5 and developed with a single-detached home constructed in 1955. The property is not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register.\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The approved Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The proposal addresses priorities within the Housing Vancouver Strategy which aligns with the Vancouver Plan.\nSecured Rental Policy (“SRP”) – The SRP encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing in Vancouver. Updates to the SRP were approved by Council in December 2021 to streamline the delivery of new rental housing. These included clarifying opportunities for rezoning in low-density areas close to public transit, shopping and other daily needs, and to streamline and simplify the rezoning process by utilizing new rental zones with standardized regulations. The SRP outlines the following locational eligibility criteria for sites in low-density areas:\n• In an existing RS or RT zone outside of recent community plan areas (excluding certain RT-zoned areas in Kitsilano and Kensington-Cedar Cottage with high proportions of heritage buildings and multiple conversion dwellings);\n• Located within close proximity to public transit and local shopping; and\n• On the first full block on either side of an eligible arterial road.\nSites that meet these criteria and that are part of the typical street grid, and have a full lane to the rear or are double-fronting may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the Residential Rental zones. In addition, the SRP considers the shape, size and\nThe SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under SRP for five-storey buildings.\n\nIn December 2021, Council approved the addition of new residential rental (\"RR\") zoning district schedules to the Zoning & Development By-law: \"RR-1\", \"RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C\", and \"RR-3A and RR-3B\". The RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed. Further direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines.\n\nThe Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027) seeks to shift the supply of new homes toward the right supply, with targets for new units along a continuum of housing types. Overall, 72,000 new homes are targeted for the 10-year period, including 12,000 social, supportive and non-profit co-operative units and 20,000 purpose-built rental units. Nearly 50% of the new units are to serve households earning less than $80,000 per year, and 40% are to be family-size units.\n",

The amendment would allow for a six-storey mixed-use rental building of which 20% of the residential floor area is secured as below-market rental units, in accordance with the Secured Rental Policy (“SRP”). An estimated total of 69 secured rental units (55 at market rates and 14 at below-market rates) would be delivered through this application. A future building design would be submitted through the development permit process and reviewed with the public at that time.

Site and Context\nThe subject site (see Figure 1) is comprised of three legal parcels fronting Victoria Drive and East 39th Avenue. The site area is approximately 1,579.4 sq. m (17,000 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 43.2 m (142 ft.) on Victoria Drive and a depth of 36.8 m (121 ft.) on East 39th Ave. This corner site is abutting two lanes to the south and east.\nFigure 1: Location Map – Site and Context\nThe site is zoned for low density multiple dwelling developments under the RT-2 District Schedule. To the east of the site are RS-1 zoned single detached houses. In all other directions, the site is surrounded by C-2 zoned properties that permit six-storey mixed-use rental buildings. The property south of the lane, at the end of the block, is zoned CD-1 and permits a six-storey mixed-use rental building with 30% of units occupied by low income households. The site is currently developed with three single detached houses constructed in the 1940s, which are not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register. The site has seven rental tenancies and the Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy applies.\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The approved Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The proposal addresses priorities within the Housing Vancouver Strategy which aligns with the Vancouver Plan.\nSecured Rental Policy (“SRP”) – The SRP encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing in Vancouver. Updates to the SRP were approved by Council in December 2021 to streamline the delivery of new rental housing. These included clarifying opportunities for rezoning in low-density areas close to public transit, shopping and other daily needs, and to streamline and simplify the rezoning process by utilizing new rental zones with standardized regulations. The SRP outlines the following locational eligibility criteria for sites in\nlow-density areas: In an existing RS or RT zone outside of recent community plan areas (excluding certain RT-zoned areas in Kitsilano and Kensington-Cedar Cottage with high proportions of heritage buildings and multiple conversion dwellings); Located within close proximity to public transit and local shopping; and On the first full block on either side of an eligible arterial road. Sites that meet these criteria and that are part of the typical street grid (including having lane or secondary street access to the rear) and are regular in shape, size and other attributes may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the new residential rental zones. The applicable option or options are further informed by the site’s size, orientation and adjacent context. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with location criteria under the SRP for six-storey buildings. RR Zoning District Schedules and Design Guidelines – Along with updates to the SRP, in December 2021 Council approved the addition of three new residential rental (“RR”) zoning district schedules to the Zoning and Development By-law: “RR-1”, “RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C”, and “RR-3A and RR-3B”. Like other standard zoning districts, the RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed. Further direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines. Recognizing that the SRP and RR zones are intended to enable incremental change in neighbourhoods that currently consist primarily of detached houses and duplexes, the guidelines support new missing middle buildings that foster neighbourliness and social connection, and contribute to an evolving streetscape which accommodates more architectural variety and diversity of housing options. Housing Vancouver Strategy – In November 2017, Council approved the Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027). The strategy seeks to shift the supply of new homes toward the right supply, with targets for new units along a continuum of housing types. The Housing Vancouver\n",

    "text": "August 29, 2023, Casey Peters contacted Vancouver City Council regarding the rezoning application for 6065-6075 Collingwood Place. The recommendation is to refer the application to a Public Hearing along with the recommendations of the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability. The rezoning application is to change the lands from RS-5 District to RR-2B District. The recommendation also includes the preparation of necessary by-laws and amendments to the Subdivision By-law. The report concludes that the application meets the intent of the Secured Rental Policy and recommends its approval in principle, subject to the Public Hearing and conditions outlined in Appendix B. The policy context includes the Vancouver Plan and the Secured Rental Policy. The subject site is comprised of two legal parcels with a total area of approximately 2,443.4 sq. m. The site is currently zoned RS-5 and developed with two single-detached homes. The proposal aligns with the priorities of the Housing Vancouver Strategy.\nThe first full block on either side of an eligible arterial road is considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the Residential Rental zones. The SRP also considers the shape, size, and other attributes of the site in determining eligibility. Rezoning to a Residential Rental zone is supported on sites where a typical building shape as generally allowed in the applicable zones can be accommodated. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under SRP for five-storey buildings.\n\nIn December 2021, Council approved the addition of new residential rental (\"RR\") zoning district schedules to the Zoning & Development By-law: \"RR-1\", \"RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C\", and \"RR-3A and RR-3B\". The RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed. Further direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines.\n\nThe SRP and RR zones are intended to enable incremental change in neighborhoods that currently consist primarily of detached houses and duplexes. The guidelines support new missing middle buildings that foster neighborliness and social connection, and contribute to an evolving streetscape which accommodates more architectural variety and diversity of housing options.\n\nIn November 2017, Council approved the Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027). The strategy seeks to shift the supply of new homes toward the right supply, with targets for new units along a continuum of housing types. The Housing Vancouver targets were based on the core goals of retaining the diversity of incomes and households in the area.\n",

Site and Context\nThe subject site is located on the southwest corner of Granville Street and West 71st Avenue. It consists of a three-lot assembly with a commercial building and a two-storey rental building. The surrounding area is undergoing significant change. Rezoning has been approved for nearby developments.\nGeorge Elementary School, Magee and Sir Winston Churchill Secondary Schools have utilization rates of 96%, 77%, and 98% respectively in 2021. By 2031, George Elementary School's utilization rate is expected to remain the same, while Magee and Sir Winston Churchill Secondary Schools will have utilization rates of 75% and 93% respectively. The Vancouver School Board will explore options to reduce pressure on schools in the area and work with City staff to plan for future growth. The Vancouver Plan, approved in July 2022, is a long-term land-use strategy for the City. The Marpole Community Plan aligns with the Vancouver Plan. Council must consider the most recent Housing Needs Report when preparing or amending a development plan related to affordable housing, rental housing, and special needs housing. If approved, this rezoning application would facilitate the delivery of secured-rental housing and address the findings within the Housing Needs Report.\n",

Site and Context\nThe subject site (see Figure 1) is comprised of two legal parcels fronting West 16th Avenue. The total site area is approximately 1,166.6 sq. m (12,557 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 34.7 m (114 ft.) along West 16th Avenue and a depth of 33.5 m (110 ft.).\nFigure 1: Location Map – Site and Context\nThis property and the surrounding area are zoned for residential uses under RT and R1-1 District Schedules with the exception of the C-1 area to the north and west that allows mixed-use developments. The site is currently zoned RT-2 and developed with two single-detached homes constructed in 1943. The properties are not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register. The property contains seven rental tenancies and the tenant protection policy does apply.\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The approved Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The proposal addresses priorities within the Housing Vancouver Strategy which aligns with the Vancouver Plan.\nSecured Rental Policy (“SRP”) – The SRP encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing in Vancouver. Updates to the SRP were approved by Council in December 2021 to streamline the delivery of new rental housing. These included clarifying opportunities for rezoning in low-density areas close to public transit, shopping and other daily needs, and to streamline and simplify the rezoning process by utilizing new rental zones with standardized regulations. The SRP outlines the following locational eligibility criteria for sites in low-density areas:\n• In an existing R1-1 or RT zone outside of recent community plan areas (excluding certain RT-zoned areas in Kitsilano and Kensington-Cedar Cottage with high proportions of heritage buildings and multiple conversion dwellings);\n• Located within close proximity to public transit and local shopping; and\n• On the first full block on either side of an eligible arterial road.\nSites that meet these criteria and that are part of the typical street grid (including having lane or secondary street access to the rear) and are regular in shape, size and other attributes may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the residential rental zones. The applicable option or options are further informed by the site’s size.\nThe SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under SRP for five-storey buildings.\n\nIn December 2021, Council approved the addition of new residential rental (\"RR\") zoning district schedules to the Zoning & Development By-law: \"RR-1\", \"RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C\", and \"RR-3A and RR-3B\". The RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed. Further direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines.\n\nThe Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027) seeks to shift the supply of new homes toward the right supply, with targets for new units along a continuum of housing types. Overall, 72,000 new homes are targeted for the 10-year period, including 12,000 social, supportive and non-profit co-operative units and 20,000 purpose-built rental units. Nearly 50% of the new units are to serve households earning less than $80,000 per year, and 40% are to be family-size units.\n\nOn April 27th, 2022, Council resolved to receive a Housing Needs Report (HNR) prepared by staff. Council must consider their most recent HNR when developing a plan.\n",

Policy Context/Council Decisions\nVancouver Plan (2022) - Approved land use strategy for long-term growth of the City.\nDowntown Official Development Plan (1975) - Guides development in the downtown district.\nGranville Street Planning Program and the Granville Street Interim Rezoning Policy (2023) - Policy direction for the area along Granville Street.\n\nPlanning Program, Council endorsed the Granville Street Interim Rezoning Policy, which allows consideration of active proposals and rezoning applications prioritizing hotel uses. The Granville Street Planning process supports the entertainment and economic nature of Granville Street and Vancouver's tourism sector, including expanding hotel use in the Study Area. The proposal for 1002-1052 Seymour Street and 550 Nelson Street aligns with these objectives.\n\nThe Metro Core Jobs and Economy Land Use Plan (2007) identifies zoning and policy changes to address a job space shortfall and meet Vancouver's 30-year economic growth targets. Downtown South is designated as an area for support services, including hotels, close to the Central Business District (CBD).\n\nThe Employment Lands and Economy Review (2020) analyzed Vancouver's economy, projected future changes, and the city's capacity to accommodate job growth under existing policy and zoning. Phase 2 of the review presented draft emerging directions to increase employment capacity in mixed-use and job-only areas, including land use tools to support new hotels.\n",

(Director: Simerjit and Gurjit Malhi) and 1121648 BC Ltd. (Director: Ajit Thaliwal) has applied to the City of Richmond for permission to develop eight townhouse units at 6571 and 6591 No. 1 Road on a site zoned \"Low Density Townhouses (RTL4)\". The site currently contains one single-family dwelling (on 6591 No 1 Road).\n\nThe site is being rezoned from \"Single Detached (RS 1/F)\" to \"Low Density Townhouses (RTL4)\" for this project under Bylaw 10288 (RZ 16-731275).\n\nA Servicing Agreement is required as a condition of rezoning and includes, but is not limited to, the following improvements:\n- Permanent closure of the existing southerly driveway (at 6591 No. 1 Road)\n- Installation of new water, storm and sanitary service connections.\n\nDevelopment Information:\nPlease refer to attached Development Application Data Sheet (Attachment 1) for a comparison of the proposed development data with the relevant Bylaw requirements.\n\nBackground:\nDevelopment surrounding the subject site is as follows:\n- To the north: A single detached dwelling on property designated for arterial road townhouse development in the Official Community Plan (OCP) and zoned \"Single Detached (RS 1/F)\".\n- To the east: Across from No. 1 Road, single detached dwellings, designated for single detached development in the OCP and zoned \"Single Detached (RS2/C)\".\n- To the south: A three-storey townhouse complex zoned \"Town Housing (ZT27)-Robson Drive/Court (Terra Nova)\".\n- To the west: A three-storey townhouse complex zoned \"Town Housing (ZT27)-Robson Drive/Court (Terra Nova)\".\n\nRezoning and Public Hearing Results:\nDuring the rezoning process, staff identified the following design issues to be resolved at the Development Permit stage:\n- Compliance with Development Permit Guidelines for the form and character of multiple-family projects provided in the OCP.\n- Refinement of landscape design, fencing and interface with abutting lots.\n- Review of retaining wall heights and requirements for guardrails.\n- Further assessment of the potential relocation of the front yard hedge.\n- Refinement of the outdoor amenity area design, including the choice of play equipment.\n- Review of relevant accessibility features for the proposed convertible unit and aging-in-place design features in all units.\n- Review of a sustainability strategy for the development proposal and ensuring that the development meets or exceeds the City's required Energy Step Code for Part 9 construction applicable at time of construction.\n\nThe Public Hearing for the rezoning of this site was held on March 21, 2022. No public correspondence was received at the Public Hearing.\n\nStaff worked with the applicant to address the above issues in the following ways:\n- Detailed architectural and landscape plans have been provided to demonstrate that the proposed development is generally consistent with the Development Permit guidelines for multi-family projects and Arterial Road Guidelines for Townhouses in the OCP.\n- Detailed landscape plans have been submitted and provide a mix of coniferous and deciduous replacement trees, which meet the bylaw size requirements.\n- The applicant has refined the design of the retaining wall and has provided handrails for the proposed steps by the southwest corner of the site as per BC Building Code requirements.\n- The hedge on-site is proposed to be relocated to the rear of the site and integrated as part of the landscaping.\n- The design of the outdoor amenity area for this townhouse development includes a children's play structure and a bench for parental interaction and to promote social interaction surrounded by landscaping.\n- The proposed accessibility features include aging-in-place features in all units and one convertible unit.\n- The applicant has provided a sustainability strategy and a letter from a Certified Energy Advisor indicating that the project will achieve Step 3 of the BC Energy Step Code with Low Carbon Emission Systems, consistent with current City regulations.\n\nStaff Comments:\nThe proposed scheme attached to this report has satisfactorily addressed the significant urban design issues and other staff comments identified as part of the review of the subject Development Permit application (Plans #1 to #20). In addition, it complies with the intent of the applicable sections of the Official Community Plan and is generally in compliance with the \"Low Density Townhouses (RTL4)\" zone, except for the zoning variance noted below.\n\nZoning Compliance Variance (staff comments in bold):\nThe applicant requests to vary the provisions of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 to reduce the minimum lot width from 50.0 m to 40.2 m. Staff supports the proposed variance as the proposal is generally consistent with the guiding principles of the Arterial Road Land Use Policy and guidelines. The need for this variance was identified in the rezoning staff report and no concerns were raised during the Public Hearing at rezoning stage. The applicant was unable to acquire the adjacent site to the north to increase the lot width as the owner advised they were not interested in selling.\n",

The existing office building is to remain on a new lot on the east portion of the subject site (Lot 2). This proposal aligns with the City's objectives of intensifying existing industrial lands. A location map of the subject site is provided in Attachment 1. A survey of the subject site showing the proposed subdivision plan is provided in Attachment 2. This proposal also involves landscaped restoration within the existing Riparian Management Area (RMA) along the south side of the existing site, as well as improvements to pedestrian circulation and landscaping within the surface parking area on Lot 2. Concurrent with this DP application, there is an application to subdivide the subject site into two lots under the existing Zl3 zone, which must be approved prior to DP issuance (SD 22-025862). A Servicing Agreement (SA) to design and construct the following improvements is required prior to Building Permit issuance, including (but not limited to):\n• Upgrading the existing watermain along the Sparwood Place frontage to meet the minimum required fire flow and fulfill the distance requirement between hydrant and the proposed building.\n• Upgrading approximately 85 m (278 ft.) of the storm sewer along the Wireless Way frontage.\n• The water, storm and sanitary service connections.\nDevelopment Information\nPlease refer to attached Development Application Data Sheet for a comparison of the proposed development data with the relevant Bylaw requirements (Attachment 3).\nExisting Site and Surrounding Context\nThe subject site is located on the south side of Wireless Way between No. 6 Road and Knight Street. The site is approximately 20,090 m2 (216,246 ft2) in area and currently contains an existing office building as well as a large surface parking area, with vehicle access from both Wireless Way and Sparwood Place. The subject site is proposed to be subdivided into two new lots of approximately 3,861 m2 (41,548 ft2) in area (Lot 1) and 16,227 m2 (174,698 ft2) in area (Lot 2).\n7451673 December 18, 2023 - 3 -\nDP 21-943418\nExisting development immediately surrounding the subject site is as follows:\n• To the North: Immediately across Wireless Way: light industrial and office buildings on lots zoned \"Industrial Business Park (IB1)\" and \"Industrial Business Park (ZI3) - Crestwood Area (East Cambie)\" at 13351 and 13353 Commerce Parkway and 13811 and 13911 Wireless Way, respectively.\n• To the East: Fronting No. 6 Road: Light industrial and office buildings on lots zoned \"Industrial Business Park (IB1)\" at 13931 Sparwood Place and 5871 No. 6 Road; Richmond Fire-Rescue's No. 7 Fireball on a lot zoned \"School & Institutional Use (SI)\" at 5731 No. 6 Road; and a surface parking lot on a lot zoned \"Industrial Business Park (ZI3) - Crestwood Area (East Cambie)\" at 5611 No. 6 Road.\n• To the South: Single-family dwellings and agricultural uses on lots zoned \"Agriculture (AG1)\" on the south side of Westminster Highway at 13560 to 13720 Westminster Highway.\n• To the West: Light industrial and office buildings on a lot zoned \"Industrial Business Park (IB1)\" at 13880 Wireless Way.\nPublic input during the DP Application Review Process\nStaff has not received any comments from the public in response to the placement of the DP Application Notification Sign on the subject site.\nStaff Comments\nThe proposed scheme attached to this report (Plans #1 to #4.C and Reference Plans) has satisfactorily addressed the significant urban design issues and other staff comments identified as part of the review of the subject DP application. In addition, it complies with the intent of the applicable sections of the Official Community Plan and is generally in compliance with the ZI3 zone, with the exception of the zoning variances noted below.\nZoning Compliance/Variances (staff comments in bold italics)\nThe Applicant requests to vary the provisions of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 to:\n1) Reduce the required number of parking spaces from 2.8 spaces to 0.75 spaces for each 100.0 m2 of gross leasable floor area of building on Lot 1.\nThe site-specific parking rate of 2.8 spaces per 100.0 m2 of gross leasable floor area of building was established with the rezoning of the site to the ZI3 zone in 2004. In 2021, the City's Zoning Bylaw was amended to include reduced parking requirements for industrial uses of 0.75 spaces per 100 m2 of gross leasable floor area. The requested variance to provide 0.75 spaces for each 100.0 m2 of gross leasable floor area of building on Lot 1 reflects the intended use of Lot 1 and is consistent with current standard parking requirements for the \"Industrial, general\" use that specified in the current Zoning Bylaw. The Applicant has proposed Transportation Demand Management (TDM) measures to support the requested variance, including an employee shuttle service between the subject site and the Bridgeport Canada Line station during peak hours, and a subsidized monthly transit pass program to Lot 1 employees, which will run for three years. 7451673\n",

Permit the construction of 16 townhouse units at 4571, 4591, and 4611/4631 Steveston Highway on a site zoned \"Low Density Townhouses (RTL4)\".\n2. Vary the provisions of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 to reduce the front yard setback along Steveston Highway from 6.0 m to 4.50 m.\n\nWayne Craig\nDirector, Development\n(604-247-4625)\n\nStaff Report\n\nOrigin: DP 20-919145\n\nJonathan King (on behalf of Gurpreet Mann, director of 0780012 BC Ltd., Jonathan King and Sandra Rotholc-King, directors of 2517294 Ontario Inc., Azim Bhimani, director of Luxor Homes & Developments Ltd., Gurpreet Mann and Narinder Mann) has applied to the City of Richmond for permission to develop 16 townhouse units at 4571, 4591, and 4611/4631 Steveston Highway. One of the townhouse units is proposed to contain a ground-level secondary suite.\n\nThe site is being rezoned from \"Single Detached (RSl/E)\" and \"Two-Unit Dwellings (RDl)\" zones to the \"Low Density Townhouses (RTL4)\" zone for this project under Bylaw 10081 (RZ 18-839945), which is currently at third reading.\n\nA Servicing Agreement is required as a condition of Building Permit issuance and includes, but is not limited to, the following improvements:\n- Removal of existing sidewalk and replacement with a new 1.5 m concrete sidewalk at the property line and minimum 1.5 m wide landscaped boulevard with street trees behind the existing curb.\n- Removal of the existing driveway crossings and replacement with the frontage works described above.\n- Construction of a new driveway crossing designed to provide \"right in, right out\" access to the site.\n\nDevelopment Information\n\nPlease refer to attached Development Application Data Sheet (Attachment 1) for a comparison of the proposed development data with the relevant Bylaw requirements.\n\nBackground\n\nDevelopment surrounding the subject site is as follows:\n- To the north: Single-family dwellings fronting Bonavista Drive on lots zoned \"Single-Detached (RS 1/B).\"\n- To the south: Across Steveston Highway, single-family dwellings on lots zoned \"Single-Detached (RS 1/B)\", which are identified for compact lot coach house development under the Arterial Road Land Use Policy.\n- To the east and west: Single-family dwellings on a lot zoned \"Single Detached (RS 1/E)\", which are identified for townhouse development under the Arterial Road Land Use Policy.\n\nRezoning and Public Hearing Results\n\nThe Public Hearing for the rezoning of this site was held on October 21, 2019. No concerns regarding the rezoning application were expressed at the Public Hearing.\n\nStaff Comments\n\nThe proposed scheme attached to this report has satisfactorily addressed the significant urban design issues and other staff comments identified as part of the review of the subject Development Permit application. In addition, it complies with the intent of the applicable sections of the Official Community Plan (OCP) and is generally in compliance with the \"Low Density Townhouse (RTL4)\", except for the zoning variance noted below.\n\nZoning Compliance/Variance (staff comments in bold)\n\nThe applicant requests to vary the provisions of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 to reduce the front yard setback along Steveston Highway from 6.0 m to 4.50 m. Staff supports the proposed variance as it is consistent with the Development Permit Guidelines for Townhouses on arterial roads in the OCP, which support front yard setbacks at 4.5 m (14.8 ft.) where a 6 m (19.7 ft.) rear yard setback to both the ground and second floors of the rear units is provided. The result will provide a wider space between the rear units of the subject development and the single-family dwellings that back onto the subject site. It will also provide a larger buffer to accommodate tree retention along the rear property line. The resulting distance from the back of the curb to the building face would be approximately 8.47 m. The reduced front yard setback does not compromise tree preservation or tree planting opportunities along the site frontage. The proposed architectural design provides appropriate building articulation and interface with neighboring properties. To address the road traffic noise from Steveston Highway, the project acoustical engineer confirmed that the proposed development is designed to meet the interior noise limits as per the CMHC standards. This variance was identified at the rezoning stage, and no concerns were identified at that time.\n\nAdvisory Design Panel Comments\n\nThe Advisory Design Panel (ADP) has reviewed the project and supports it. A copy of the relevant excerpt from the Advisory Design Panel Minutes from Thursday, July 20, 2023 is attached for reference (Attachment 2). The design response from the applicant has been included immediately following the specific Design Panel comments and is identified in 'bold italics'.\n\nAnalysis\n\nConditions of Adjacency\n- The proposed form, massing, and orientation of the buildings are compatible with the existing adjacent developments on the block.\n- While three-storey units are proposed along Steveston Highway, the building height is stepped down to two-storeys along the east property line to provide appropriate transition to the adjacent single-family home.\n- Along the west property line, an entry driveway is being proposed and the three-storey building will be set back 9.42 m from the west property line.\n- Two-storey units in duplex form, as well as the outdoor amenity area, are proposed along the rear (north) property line to minimize privacy and overlook concerns.\n",

A copy of a location map is attached (Attachment 1). The site currently contains one single detached house, which is proposed to be demolished (Attachment 2).\n\nDevelopment Information\n\nPlease refer to the attached Development Application Data Sheet (Attachment 3) for a comparison of the proposed development data with the relevant Bylaw requirements.\n\nBackground\n\nDevelopment surrounding the subject site is as follows:\nTo the north: A single detached house on a lot zoned \"Single Detached with Granny Flat or Coach House - Edgemere (REI)\".\nTo the south: A single detached house on a lot zoned \"Single Detached with Granny Flat or Coach House - Edgemere (REI)\".\nTo the east: Across Ainsworth Crescent, a single detached house on a lot zoned \"Single Detached with Granny Flat or Coach House - Edgemere (REI)\".\nTo the west: Across the rear lane, a single detached house on a lot zoned \"Single Detached with Granny Flat or Coach House - Edgemere (REI)\".\n\nStaff Comments\n\nThe proposed scheme attached to this report has satisfactorily addressed the significant urban design issues and other staff comments identified as part of the review of the subject Development Permit application. In addition, it complies with the intent of the design guidelines for coach houses in the Edgemere neighbourhood contained in the City's Official Community Plan (OCP), and complies with the \"Single Detached with Granny Flat or Coach House - Edgemere (REI)\" zone except the below noted variances.\n\nZoning Compliance/Variances\n\nThe applicant has requested to vary the provisions of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 to:\n1. Increase the maximum setback that a coach house is permitted to be located from the south property line from 2.0 m to 5.95 m.\n2. Decrease the minimum setback that a coach house is permitted to be located from the north property line from 2.0 m to 0.90 m.\n\nThe applicant has requested the above variances in order to locate the coach house safely outside of the tree protection zone of a significant tree (Tree ID# os3 - Douglas Fir, DBH 110 cm) located on the neighbouring property to the south (see Tree Retention and Replacement Plan, Attachment 4). In order to ensure that the entirety of the proposed coach house and garage are located outside of the Tree Protection Zone, while also maintaining consistency with Coach House design guidelines, the applicant proposes to shift the coach house and garage to the north side of the property.\n\nStaff supports the proposed variances as they provide for the retention of a significant tree (a 15 m tall Douglas fir with a diameter of 110 cm) which is in good condition. The City Arborist has reviewed the submitted Arborist Report and supports the efforts taken to shift the proposed coach house and garage as far to the north as possible, such that the development is located entirely outside of the Tree Protection Zone.\n\nThe proposed variances do not interfere with the overall design of the coach house which is generally consistent with the Development Permit guidelines. The applicant has also provided a shadow analysis (Attachment 5) that demonstrates that the variances to the setback requirements in the zone will not result in undue shadowing of the adjacent property to the north.\n\nAnalysis\n\nConditions of Adjacency:\n- The proposed coach house design relates to the proposed single detached housing form, character, and scale of the surrounding neighbourhood.\n- The proposed location of the coach house, which is set back between 1.5 m and 3.0 m from the rear lane, provides an adequate buffer to the adjacent lot to the west.\n- The majority of the floor space in the coach house building is proposed on the ground floor (60 per cent, i.e., entry, powder room, living, kitchen/dining), and the portion of the floor space located in the upper half-storey of the coach house is located in the middle of the overall building.\n- There are no windows proposed on the north or south side elevations to address concerns of overlook into the neighbouring properties. There are windows proposed on the west and east elevations of the coach house to provide passive surveillance of the lane and maximize light penetration.\n\nUrban Design and Site Planning:\n- Consistent with the OCP guidelines for coach houses in the Edgemere neighbourhood, the proposed primary pedestrian entry to the coach house is from the rear lane, and secondary pedestrian access to the coach house is proposed via a pathway from Ainsworth Crescent along the south side of the property.\n- The west elevation of the coach house that faces the lane has been designed as the primary facade, with a main window off the living area at grade, wood posts with stone bases on either side of the covered front porch, as well as exterior wall and landscape lighting to enhance visibility and appearance of the lane as a public space.\n",

    "text": "City of Richmond To: Development Permit Panel From: Wayne Craig Director of Development Report to Development Permit Panel Date: May 24, 2023 File: DP 21-936149 Re: Application by Gradual Architecture Inc. for a Development Permit at 6520 Williams Road Staff Recommendation That a Development Permit be issued which would: 1. Permit the construction of eight townhouse units at 6520 Williams Road on a site zoned \"Low Density Townhouses (RTL4)\"; and 2. Vary the provision of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 to reduce the minimum required lot width from 40.0 m to 36.6 m. Wayne Craig Director of Development WC:mp Att. 2 7049603 May 24, 2023 - 2 - DP 21-936149 Staff Report Origin Gradual Architecture Inc. has applied to the City of Richmond on behalf of Londonpark Holdings Ltd. (Director Long Fei Liu) for permission to develop eight (8) townhouse dwellings at 6520 Williams Road on a site zoned \"Low Density Townhouses (RTL4)\". The site currently contains a single detached dwelling which does not contain a secondary suite. The existing dwelling would be demolished. A location map is provided in Attachment 1. The site is being rezoned from the \"Single Detached (RS 1/E)\" zone to the \"Low Density Townhouses (RTL4)\" zone for this project under Bylaw 10224 (RZ 17-792242). A Servicing Agreement is required as a condition of building permit issuance and includes, but is not limited to, the following improvements: • 0.1 m road dedication along the entire Williams Road frontage; and • Removal of the existing sidewalk and replacement with new 1.5 m concrete sidewalk at the property line, 1.5 m landscaped boulevard with street trees and street lighting, and 0.15 m curb and gutter. Development Information Please refer to attached Development Application Data Sheet (Attachment 2) for a comparison of the proposed development data with the relevant Bylaw requirements. Background Development surrounding the subject site is as follows: To the north: Across Williams Rd, a single detached dwelling on a property zoned \"Single Detached (RS 1/C)\" with vehicle access from Sheridan Road. To the south and west: Steveston London Secondary School and Park on properties zoned \"School and Institutional Use (SI)\". A single detached dwelling on a property zoned \"Single Detached (RS 1/E)\" with vehicle access from Williams Road. This property is part of a separate rezoning application including both the properties at 6560 and 6580 Williams Road (RZ 21-945388), which is currently under staff review. The proposed rezoning would permit development of townhouses with shared vehicle access from the subject site. Rezoning and Public Hearing Results During the rezoning process, staff identified the following design issues to be resolved at the Development Permit stage: • Compliance with Development Permit Guidelines for the form and character of multiple-family projects provided in the Official Community Plan (OCP). 7049603 May 24, 2023 - 3 - DP 21-936149 • Articulation of the west elevations adjacent to the park space to enhance the buildings' appearance and maximize sunlight and views. • Review of the size and species of on-site trees to ensure bylaw compliance and to achieve an acceptable mix of coniferous and deciduous species on-site. • Review of the proposed driveway design and requirement for a vehicle turn-around area, and possibility of retaining Tree #7 if the adjacent site to the east proceeds for redevelopment. • Refinement of the shared outdoor amenity area design, including the choice of play equipment, to create a safe and vibrant environment for children's play and social interaction. • Review the long-term design of the temporary turn-around area, such as future conversion to additional outdoor amenity space. • Review of relevant accessibility features for the one proposed convertible unit and aging-in-place design features in all units. • Review of a sustainability strategy for the development proposal. The Public Hearing for the rezoning of this site was held on February 16, 2021. No public correspondence was received at the Public Hearing. Staff worked with the applicant to address the above design issues in the following ways: • Detailed architectural and landscape plans have been provided to demonstrate that the proposed development is generally consistent with the Development Permit guidelines for multi-family projects and Arterial Road Guidelines for Townhouses in the OCP. • The applicant has refined the design while maintaining the general character presented to Council at the rezoning stage. • The west elevations of the buildings have been modified by providing additional glazing and architectural details to add visual interest and take advantage of the natural sunlight and views to better orient end units to the adjacent park. • Detailed landscape plans have been submitted to provide for a mix of coniferous and deciduous replacement trees, which meet the bylaw size requirements. • The proposed driveway design has been reviewed and approved by the Transportation Department. • The on-site vehicle tum-around area is required for the proposed development as the rezoning application for the proposed townhouse development on the adjacent sites at 6250 and 6280 Williams Road is still under staff review. Tree #7 would be removed to enable the construction of the required vehicle turn-around area. • The design of the outdoor amenity area for this proposal includes two children's play structures and a bench to promote social interaction. • A plan showing details of the conversion of the above-noted on-site tum-around area into expanded outdoor amenity, once the adjacent site access has been developed, is attached the DP. • The proposed accessibility features include aging-in-place features in all units and one convertible unit. • The applicant has provided a sustainability strategy and a letter from a Certified Energy Advisor indicating that the project will achieve Step 3 of the BC Energy Step Code consistent with current City regulations. The above issues are discussed further in the \"Analysis\" section of this report. 7049603\n",

Permit the replacement of all the existing single-glazed windows with new double-glazed windows, the replacement of two doors on the front (north) elevation, and the removal of the overhead garage door on the rear (south) elevation at 12551 No. 1 Road.\n2. Vary the provision of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 to reduce the minimum front yard setback to the garbage and recycling enclosure from 3.0 m to Om.\n\nWayne Craig\nDirector, Development\n(604-247-4625)\nWC:mp\nAtt. 3\n7106166\nMay 24, 2023\n\nStaff Report\nOrigin: DP 21-935984\n\nGordon Chan has applied to the City of Richmond on behalf of Public Services and Procurement Canada for permission to replace all the existing 18 single-glazed windows with double-glazed windows of the existing office building for Fisheries and Oceans Canada at 12551 No. 1 Road. The applicant also proposes to replace two doors on the front (north) elevation and remove the existing overhead garage door on the rear (south) elevation.\n\nThe subject property is split-zoned: most of the site is zoned \"Light Industrial (IL)\", and the small triangular portion along Bayview Street is zoned \"Steveston Commercial (CS2)\". A location map is included in Attachment 1. The subject property is located within the Steveston Village Heritage Conservation Area (SVHCA); it is not one of the identified heritage resources (i.e., protected heritage properties). Both a Heritage Alteration Permit and Development Permit applications were submitted for the proposed exterior changes. However, with recent changes to the Heritage Procedures Bylaw approved by Council on May 15, 2023, only a Development Permit is required for exterior changes to non-heritage properties in the SVHCA. Therefore, the associated Heritage Alteration Permit application is no longer required and the Development Permit application will be used to consider the proposed changes.\n\nDevelopment Information:\nPlease refer to attached Development Application Data Sheet (Attachment 2) for a comparison of the proposed development data with the relevant Bylaw requirements.\n\nBackground:\nDevelopment surrounding the subject site is as follows:\nTo the north: Across Bayview Street is a vacant property at 12451 No. 1 Road on a site zoned \"Steveston Commercial (CS2)\". The property is currently landscaped with trees and lawn. The property contains an identified heritage resource, the curved roadway pattern as a trace in the landscape of the original Canadian Pacific Railway track that extended along the waterfront to the Gulf of Georgia Cannery.\nTo the east: Immediately to the east is the south end of No. 1 Road with a pier and boat dock and the No. 1 Road South Discharge station, which is an identified heritage resource.\nTo the south: South Arm Fraser River.\nTo the west: A one-storey, multi-tenant commercial building at 3900 Bayview Street on a site zoned \"Steveston Commercial (CS2)\".\n\n7106166\nMay 24, 2023\n\nDP 21-935984\n\nStaff Comments:\nThe proposed scheme attached to this report has satisfactorily addressed the urban design issues and other staff comments identified as part of the review of the subject Development Permit application. In addition, it is generally in compliance with the \"IL\" zone, with the exception of the zoning variance noted below.\n\nZoning Compliance/Variance:\nThe applicant requests to vary the provision of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 to reduce the minimum front yard setback of 3.0 m from the IL zone boundary to Om to accommodate an enclosure to better screen the existing garbage and recycling containers adjacent to the public sidewalk. The enclosure must comply with the setbacks in the zone.\n\n- In accordance with section 3.2.4 of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500, where a lot is located in more than one zone, siting regulations shall apply as if the zone boundary were a lot line. There is no minimum front yard, side yard, or rear yard setback requirement in the \"Steveston Commercial (CS2)\" zone, but the \"Light Industrial (IL)\" zone requires a minimum of 3.0 m front yard setback.\n- The applicant has noted that the rear yard of the subject site is currently used for a compound by various federal agencies with a security gate to restrict access, so the garbage and recycling containers cannot be located in the rear yard. The proposed location at the northwest corner of the property has been selected to minimize interference with pedestrian traffic and other vehicular access and to ensure compliance with the B.C. Building Code and Richmond Fire Bylaw (e.g. spatial separation requirement).\n- Staff are supportive of this variance request as it allows the enclosure to be constructed to screen the garbage and recycling containers from public view and enhance the overall streetscape along Bayview Street.\n- The front property line is located to the north of the IL zone boundary and is parallel to Bayview Street, so the front yard setback measured from the front property line is greater (2.0 m to the northeast corner of the proposed enclosure).\n- The design of the enclosure has been reviewed as part of the DP application process and will be discussed in detail in the \"Analysis\" section of this report.\n- There are no changes to parking and access to the site as a result of this variance.\n\nRichmond Heritage Commission Comments:\nThe applications were reviewed by the Richmond Heritage Commission (RHC) on April 6, 2022, and the RHC adopted the following resolution:\n\n7106166\nThat the Richmond Heritage Commission support the DP and HAP applications (DP 21-985984 & HA21-985982) for 12551 No. 1 Road subject to a future review of the encroachment issue to ensure the streetscape and urban design is compatible with the Steveston Village Heritage Conservation Area.\n",

Wayne Craig, Director, Development (604-247-4625). WC:cl. Att. 3. 7267244. June 15, 2023. Staff Report. Origin: DP 21-936427. Kadium No. 4 Development Ltd. has applied to the City of Richmond for permission to develop 19 townhouse units, including four secondary suites, at 10340, 10360, 10380, 10400, and 10420 No. 4 Road on a site zoned \"Medium Density Townhouses (RTM2)\". A location map is provided in Attachment 1. The site is being rezoned from the \"Single Detached (RS 1/E)\" zone to the \"Medium Density Townhouses (RTM2)\" zone for this project under Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500, Amendment Bylaw 10261 (RZ 18-831725). The Bylaw was given third reading at the Public Hearing held June 21, 2021, and the applicant is working to complete all of the rezoning requirements. A Servicing Agreement is required as a condition of rezoning bylaw adoption and includes, but is not limited to, upgrading approximately 80 m of sanitary sewer on-site and along the shared property line with the properties at 10251, 10271, 10291, and 10311 Dennis Crescent, as well as road improvements involving road dedication and construction of a new treed/grass boulevard at the curb, off-street bike path, and concrete sidewalk along the subject site frontage, and construction of an interim asphalt walkway at the curb from 10300 No. 4 Road to the north end of the block at Wilkinson Road. Development Information: Please refer to attached Development Application Data Sheet for a comparison of the proposed development data with the relevant Bylaw requirements (Attachment 2). Background: The subject site is located on the east side of No. 4 Road between Steveston Highway and Wilkinson Road. The site is currently vacant, with five driveway crossings on No. 4 Road. Existing development immediately surrounding the subject site includes single-family dwellings on lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS 1/E)\" fronting No. 4 Road to the north, south, and west, and single-family dwellings on lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS 1/E)\" fronting Dennis Crescent to the east. Rezoning and Public Hearing Results: The Public Hearing for the rezoning of this site was held on June 21, 2021. Although no members of the public were in attendance at the Public Hearing, one letter from a nearby resident was received citing concerns about the proposed change in land use from single-family housing to townhousing and potential traffic and safety concerns. Staff note that the proposed use is consistent with the OCP and Arterial Road Land Use Policy, and the proposed development would have only one access to No 4 Road, thereby reducing the number of vehicle access points along this stretch of roadway. Bylaw 10261 for the rezoning of the subject site was given third reading following the Public Hearing. During the rezoning process, staff identified design issues to be resolved at the Development Permit (DP) stage, including compliance with the DP Guidelines for the form and character of multiple-family projects in the Official Community Plan (OCP), confirmation of interior noise levels and noise mitigation measures, refinement of the landscape design and interface with adjacent single-family housing, refinement of the shared outdoor amenity space design, review of the units that include secondary suites, review of accessibility features, review of a sustainability strategy, ensuring satisfactory plantings within the Statutory Right-of-Way (SRW) for the sanitary sewer, ensuring proposed tree relocations are viable, and accommodation of hedge Hl-H7 if possible. Through the review of this DP application, staff worked with the applicant to address the design issues and ensure consistency with the applicable design guidelines contained within the OCP. The applicant has made revisions to the proposal to address the design issues identified, including revisions to the Landscape Plan, demonstration of functional design for units containing secondary suites, incorporation of relevant accessibility features, refinement of lot grading, and ensuring appropriate transition to neighboring lots. 7267244.\n",

The application included an amendment to the Single Family Lot Size Policy 5442 to exclude the subject site from the policy. The Lot Size Policy amendment was approved following the Public Hearing.\nThe rezoning Bylaw was given third reading at the Public Hearing held on December 19, 2022 and the applicant is working to complete all of the rezoning requirements. The site currently contains a single-family dwelling that is occupied by a rental tenant who has been made aware of the application and timeline.\nA Servicing Agreement is required as a condition of subdivision approval and includes, but is not limited to, the following improvements:\n• Provision of water, storm and sanitary sewer connections, water meters and inspection chambers as required for each lot.\n• Frontage upgrades including installation of a new 2.0 m wide concrete sidewalk with a 1.5 m wide treed/grass boulevard.\nThe transportation department has also indicated that upgrade to or relocation to Translink bus stop infrastructure will be investigated at the Servicing agreement stage.\nDevelopment Information: Please refer to attached Development Application Data Sheet (Attachment 1) for a comparison of the proposed development data with the relevant Bylaw requirements.\nBackground: The subject site consists of a large lot containing a single-family dwelling that is occupied by a rental tenant. There are no secondary suites in the dwelling. The existing dwelling is proposed to be demolished at future development stage.\nDevelopment surrounding the subject site is as follows:\nTo the North: Lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS 1/E)\" each containing a single-detached dwelling.\nTo the South: Lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS 1/E)\" each containing a single-detached dwelling.\nTo the East: Fronting Sunnywood Drive, lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS 1/E)\" each containing a single-family dwelling.\nTo the West: Across Gilbert Road, lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS 1/E)\" each containing a single-family dwelling.\nRezoning and Public Hearing Results: During the rezoning process, staff identified the following design issues to be resolved at the Development Permit stage:\n• Ensuring appropriate massing and interface with adjacent single-family dwellings on adjacent sites.\n• Refining the provision of private outdoor space for the front units to include a secondary space that is not in the front yard.\n• Refining the concept shown on the site plan for the boulevard upgrades to reflect that the transition to the existing treatments to the north and south of the site is to occur within the subject site frontage.\n• Exploring opportunities for aging-in-place and Convertible Unit Features to be incorporated into dwelling design.\n• Investigating with external agencies whether the existing bus stop along Gilbert Road needs to be relocated due to its proximity to the proposed driveway crossing.\n• Reviewing the proposed exterior building material and colour palette.\n• Reviewing the applicant's design response to the principles of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED).\n• Gaining a better understanding of the proposed sustainability features to be incorporated into the project.\nThrough the review of this DP application, staff worked with the applicant to address the design issues to staff's satisfaction. The applicant has made the following revisions to their proposal to address the design issues identified:\n• Further refinement to the overall site plan was completed to ensure the adequate provision of private outdoor space was met.\n• Accessibility features have been verified to include aging-in-place features in all units and the provision of one convertible unit.\n• Refinements were made to layout of boulevard upgrades to ensure sidewalk transition occurred on the subject site frontage. Initial investigation regarding an upgrade to Translink Bus Stop was completed and works relating will be determined at the Servicing Agreement stage.\n• Updates have been made to the building's exterior material and colour palate to ensure that the rear units are more visible from the street.\nThe Public Hearing for the rezoning of this site was held on December 19, 2022. At the Public Hearing, no concerns about rezoning the property were expressed by members of the public. Bylaw 10428 for the rezoning of the subject site was given third reading following the Public Hearing.\n7266405\n",

The proposed project includes the development of previously secured ESA compensation areas.\n\nDevelopment Information: The subject site is currently occupied by buildings and structures associated with the existing wastewater treatment plant.\n\nDevelopment surrounding the site includes the North Arm of the Fraser River to the north, Iona Beach Regional Park to the east, Iona Island causeway to the south, and Iona Beach and North Arm Jetty to the west.\n\nStaff Comments: The proposed scheme addresses ESA issues and complies with the Official Community Plan and zoning requirements. No variances are being sought.\n\nAdvisory Design Panel Comments: The Advisory Design Panel has not reviewed the application as it does not involve building design components.\n\nAnalysis: The IIWWTP currently provides primary sewage treatment through sludge removal and anaerobic digestion. The proposed upgrades will enhance the treatment process.\n\nSite Planning: The proposed project will incorporate secondary and tertiary treatment facilities into the existing wastewater treatment plant.\n",

Reduce the minimum required rear yard setback for a portion of the second storey from 10.70 m to 10.64 m at 7151 Bridge Street to retain an existing second-storey deck.\n   2. Reduce the minimum required rear yard setback for accessory buildings with a wall length greater than 6.0 m from 2.4 m to 2.08 m at 7211 Bridge Street to retain an existing detached garage.\n   3. Reduce the minimum required rear yard setback for 60% of the first storey from 9.60 m to 7.4 m, as well as the remaining 40% of the first storey and the second storey from 10.70 m to 8.0 m at 7231 Bridge Street to retain an existing dwelling. Also, reduce the minimum required rear yard setback for a portion of the second storey from 10.7 m to 6.8 m to retain an existing second-storey deck.\n   4. Reduce the minimum required rear yard setback for 60% of the first storey from 9.60 m to 7.02 m, as well as the remaining 40% of the first storey and the second storey from 10.70 m to 7.02 m at 7251 Bridge Street to retain an existing dwelling.\n\nBackground:\n- Khalid Hassan has applied on behalf of the owners for permission to reduce the minimum rear yard setback requirements for four properties in a proposed 16 lot subdivision.\n- The properties were part of a rezoning application adopted by City Council on December 21, 2022.\n- The rezoning application aims to create six lots fronting Bridge Street and ten lots fronting an extension to Armstrong Street while retaining the existing homes on Bridge Street.\n- Variances to the rear yard setback provisions are required for four of the lots on Bridge Street.\n\nDevelopment Information:\n- The subject properties are part of a rezoning application to create 16 single-family lots.\n- The proposed variances are necessary to retain the existing structures on four of the lots.\n- If the variances are not approved, the existing structures would need to be modified or removed before subdivision approval.\n\nAnalysis:\n- The applicant requests variances to reduce the minimum rear yard setbacks for various reasons.\n- Staff supports the proposed variances because they do not facilitate new construction and only permit the retention of existing houses in good condition.\n- Any new construction would still need to comply with the minimum setback requirements of Zoning Bylaw 8500.\n- The retention of existing single-family homes was identified during the rezoning application.\n- The proposed setback variances do not affect the tree retention secured through the rezoning process or the applicant's commitment to provide new trees on-site.\n- The adjacent properties to the west, created upon subdivision, will be owned by the applicant.\n",

This includes upgrades to the on-site landscaping and the existing garbage and recycling enclosure on a site zoned \"Auto-Oriented Commercial (CA)\".\n\nDevelopment Information\nThis Development Permit only applies to the portion of the building that contains the existing McDonald's restaurant (Unit 115) and immediate surrounding on-site landscaping and vehicle circulation areas. No rezoning application is required, and no servicing or infrastructure works are needed.\n\nBackground\nThe existing McDonald's restaurant is a one-storey building with a drive-through service component. The proposed modifications will only be made to the McDonald's restaurant and not the neighboring commercial retail unit. The site is part of a commercial complex with other businesses and off-street parking.\n\nDevelopment surrounding the subject site:\n- To the north: a business park zoned \"Industrial Business Park (IB 1)\"\n- To the east: an access road and a one-storey commercial building on a site zoned \"Auto-Oriented Commercial (CA)\"\n- To the south: Highway 99 and an existing hotel on a site zoned \"Auto-Oriented Commercial (CA)\"\n- To the west: Highway 99 and the off-ramp for the Cambie Road overpass\n\nStaff Comments\nThe proposed scheme satisfactorily addresses urban design issues and staff comments. It complies with the Official Community Plan and the \"Auto-Oriented Commercial (CA)\" zone.\n\nAdvisory Design Panel Comments\nDue to the minor nature of the renovations, the application was not presented to the Advisory Design Panel.\n\nAnalysis\nConditions of Adjacency:\n- Modifications to the on-site enclosure for garbage, recycling, and organic waste are being undertaken. The enclosure will be fully enclosed and screened from the sidewalk.\n- No modifications to the building's mechanical systems are required.\n- Existing rooftop mechanical units will be screened.\n- Drive-through operations audio/speaker box system is oriented to minimize impacts and adjust volume based on ambient noise conditions.\n- No acoustical study was required.\n\nUrban Design and Site Planning:\n- The modifications are primarily limited to the building exterior, existing landscape areas, and service area.\n- Off-street parking, vehicle circulation, and drive-through servicing will generally remain unchanged.\n- Additional modifications include parking stall curb stops, pavement markings, maintaining pedestrian linkage, and implementing additional signage.\n- The drive-through configuration will be maintained.\n- The surrounding off-street parking provides for 25 vehicle parking stalls, complying with requirements.\n",

The site is currently zoned as \"Industrial (I)\" and is used for truck and industrial equipment storage. There are no permanent structures on the site, except for two shipping containers used as an office space. The proposed barge ramp would be located within the ESA portion of the site.\n\nStaff Comments: The proposed barge ramp would impact the ESA designated areas on the site. While industrial uses are allowed without a Development Permit, the installation of a barge loading facility within the ESA requires an ESA Development Permit. The proposed scheme addresses environmental concerns and complies with the Official Community Plan and the \"Industrial (I)\" zone.\n\nAnalysis: The owner plans to construct a barge ramp in the water lot in front of the site for transporting aggregate materials. No aggregate materials would be stored on-site. The water lot is currently leased and used for log storage. The owner has entered into a memorandum of understanding with the leaseholder and has submitted a crown land lease application to the Province for the change in water lot use. Access to the ramp would be provided via a truck staging area and a drive aisle on the site. The development would not include any additional buildings or structures beyond the barge ramp. The existing office operation in the shipping containers would remain. The site would be raised to prepare for future dike improvements and climate change effects, with lock block walls installed along the property lines. Truck traffic would access the barges via the raised surface.\n\nSenior Governmental Approvals: The proposed barge ramp facility requires approvals from multiple regulatory agencies in addition to the City of Richmond.\n",

The development is nearing completion with interior finishing work in progress and landscaping work remaining.\n\nStaff Comments: The proposed modification to the Tree Management Plan and Landscape Plan is to address the deterioration and irreversible decline of a tree (Tree Tag #726) that was supposed to be retained. The proposed changes do not impact any works associated with the Servicing Agreement.\n\nSummary of Tree Protection and Replacement Plan:\n- Ten trees were identified to be retained and protected, with this report specifically addressing Tree 726.\n- The south side yard setback at the southwest corner of the site was increased to 7.56 m to retain the Sycamore maple tree (Tree 726).\n- Tree protection fencing was installed around all retained trees prior to construction activities.\n- A Tree Management Plan and Landscape Plan were issued with the Development Permit.\n- The applicant agreed to plant 62 new trees on-site, including 13 conifers and 49 deciduous trees.\n\nAnalysis: Tree 726 has shown signs of decline since June 2022 and is in an advanced state of irreversible decline, according to the Project Arborist's findings. The City's Tree Preservation staff have reviewed and agreed with these findings.\n\nNote: Attachments 1-5 provide additional details and plans related to the General Compliance ruling.\n\nWayne Craig\nDirector, Development\n",

The proposed rezoning and subdivision complies with Section 2.3.7 and would result in the creation of two single-family lots being 444.9 m2 and 450.2 m2 in area. Further, the proposed rezoning and subdivision would comply with the minimum lot dimensions and size applicable to the “Single Detached (RS2B)” zone.\n\nMinistry of Transportation & Infrastructure Approval\nAs the subject site is located within 800 m of an intersection of a Provincial Limited Access Highway and a City road, this redevelopment proposal was referred to the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MOTI) for review and comment.

The existing two-family dwelling is owner-occupied and does not contain any secondary suites.\n\nSurrounding Development: To the North: An existing strata-titled duplex on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”. To the South: Existing single detached houses on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”. To the East: An existing strata-titled duplex on a lot zoned “Two-Unit Dwellings (RD1)”. To the West: Single family dwellings on lots zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)” across Bonavista Gate.\n\nRelated Policies & Studies: Official Community Plan/Steveston Area Plan: The property is designated as Neighbourhood Residential in the Official Community Plan (OCP), and as Single Family in the Steveston Area Plan.\n\nFloodplain Management Implementation Strategy: The proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204.

The applicant has been advised that encroachment into the SRW is not permitted. A City Covenant is registered on both 10840 and 10860 Bonavista Gate Titles that restrict the development to a duplex, therefore, the duplex covenants must be discharged from Title prior to the final adoption of the rezoning bylaw. There is a Land Tax Deferment Act Agreement currently registered on the 10840 Bonavista Gate Title (proposed Lot A), which allows the property owner to defer the payment of taxes.

Ltd. (Balraj Singh Sanghera and Rajbir Kaur Chatha), to rezone 11831/11833 Seabrook Crescent from the “Single Detached (RS1/E)” zone to the “Single Detached (RS2/B)” zone in order to permit the property to be subdivided into two single-family lots, each with vehicle access from Seabrook Crescent. A location map and aerial photo are provided in Attachment 1. The proposed subdivision plan and draft site plan are provided in Attachment 2.\nFindings of Fact\nA Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached (Attachment 3).\nSubject Site Existing Housing Profile\nThe subject site contains an existing un-stratified non-conforming duplex (two-unit dwelling), which will be demolished prior to subdivision. Both dwelling units are currently tenant occupied and do not contain any secondary suites. The applicant has indicated that the tenants are aware of the redevelopment proposal and the applicant will ensure compliance with the Residential Tenancy Act.\nSurrounding Development\nDevelopment immediately surrounding the site is as follows:\nTo the North: A single-family houses on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”.\nTo the South: A single-family houses on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”.\nTo the East: Across the lane, an existing duplex on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)” fronting onto No. 5 Road. There is a Rezoning application and Development Permit (RZ 22-019002/DP 23-028942) at 10111/10113 No. 5 Road to permit the development of three front-back duplex lots. The rezoning application received third reading on October 16, 2023.\nTo the West: Across Seabrook Crescent, an existing duplex on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”.\nRelated Policies & Studies\nOfficial Community Plan\nThe subject site is designated as “Neighbourhood Residential” in the Official Community Plan (OCP). This proposal is consistent with this OCP designation.\nPH - 38\nOctober 23, 2023\n- 3 -\nRZ 22-010976\n7409688\nSingle-Family Lot Size Policy 5434/ Zoning Bylaw 8500\nThe subject property is located within the area covered by Lot Size Policy 5434, adopted by City Council in 1990, amended in 1991 and 2006 (Attachment 4). The Policy permits a majority of lots within the Policy Area (including the subject property) to be rezoned and subdivided in accordance with the provisions of the “Single Detached (RS1/E)” zone.\nThe subject site is currently occupied by a legal duplex. Section 2.3.7 of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 provides that the Lot Size Policy does not apply to a rezoning that a legal duplex and which are intended to be subdivided into no more than two single-family lots. The proposed rezoning and subdivision complies with Section 2.3.7 and would result in the creation of two single-family lots being 444.9 m2 and 450.2 m2 in area. Further, the proposed rezoning and subdivision would comply with the minimum lot dimensions and size applicable to the “Single Detached (RS2B)” zone.\nMinistry of Transportation & Infrastructure Approval\nAs the subject site is located within 800 m of an intersection of a Provincial Limited Access Highway and a City road, this redevelopment proposal was referred to the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MOTI) for review and comment. Preliminary confirmation has been received from MOTI indicating that they have no objections to the proposed redevelopment. Final approval from MOTI is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\nFloodplain Management Implementation Strategy\nThe proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\nPublic Consultation\nA rezoning sign has been installed on the subject property. Staff have not received any comments from the public about the rezoning application in response to the placement of the rezoning sign on the property.\nShould the Planning Committee endorse this application and Council grant first reading to the rezoning bylaw, the bylaw will be forwarded to a Public Hearing, where any area resident or interested party will have an opportunity to comment.\nPublic notification for the Public Hearing will be provided as per the Local Government Act and the City’s Zoning Bylaw 8500.\nPH - 39\n",
