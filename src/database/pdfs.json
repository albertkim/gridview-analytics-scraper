The proposed amendment would rezone the property from R1-1 (Residential Inclusive) District to RM-8A (Residential) District to allow for a townhouse or rowhouse development. The maximum floor space ratio (FSR) for RM-8A can be up to 1.20. Based on the site area, approximately eight townhouses can be achieved at this location.\nThe application meets the intent of the Cambie Corridor Plan (the “Plan”). Staff recommend that the application be referred to a Public Hearing, with the recommendation of the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability to approve it in principle, subject to the Public Hearing, and conditions contained within Appendix B.\nCOUNCIL AUTHORITY/PREVIOUS DECISIONS\n• Vancouver Plan (2022)\n• Cambie Corridor Plan (2018, amended 2023)\n• RM-8, RM-8A, RM-8N and RM-8AN Districts Schedule (2018, amended 2023)\n• RM-8, RM-8N, RM-8A and RM-8AN Guidelines (2018, amended 2023)\n• Housing Needs Report (2022)\n• Bulletin: Density Bonus Contributions (2014, amended 2023)\n• Vancouver Development Cost Levy By-Law No. 9755\n• Vancouver Utilities Development Cost Levy By-Law No. 12183\n• Latecomer Policy (2021)\n• Urban Forest Strategy (2014)\nREPORT\nBackground/Context\n1. Site and Context\nThe subject site at 688 West 29th Avenue (see Figure 1) is comprised of one legal parcel along West 29th Avenue and east of Heather Street. The site area is approximately 605.2 sq. m (6,515 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 17.1 m (56 ft.) along 29th Avenue and a depth of 35.5 m (117 ft.).\nThe site and area to the east are zoned R1-1 and developed with single-detached houses. Surrounding sites have been rezoned to RM-8A and the BC Women’s and Children’s Hospital to the west is zoned CD-1. The area is eligible for rezoning to RM-8A under the Plan.\nThe house on the subject property was constructed in 1988 and is not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register. As a single-lot development with secondary rental, the Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy does not apply.\nFigure 1: Location Map – Site and Context\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The site is located within the Cambie Corridor Plan which is in alignment with the Vancouver Plan.\nCambie Corridor Plan – The Plan guides the transformation of the Corridor into an area where people can live, work, shop, play and learn – all within close proximity to the Canada Line. The Corridor’s population is anticipated to double by 2041, with 30,000 new homes, making it one of the largest growth areas outside of downtown.\nThe Plan identifies over 1,100 detached lots as eligible to be redeveloped as townhouses, creating opportunities for approximately 8,200 units of much-needed, ground-oriented housing. Specifically, Section 4.2.9 of the Plan supports residential townhouses or rowhouses for up to three storeys and a maximum density of 1.20 FSR.\nThe subject site is located within the Queen Elizabeth neighbourhood, characterized by its existing low-density residential character and green park-like setting.\nDesign Guidelines – The RM-8A/AN Districts Schedule is accompanied by clear design guidelines. These guidelines establish form of development expectations which provide predictability and certainty for new buildings. Design criteria sets out expected typologies, requirements for family housing, access to sunlight, privacy, landscape treatment, along with flexible development options for smaller lots (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2: Form of Development per the Design Guidelines – (Courtyard Rowhouses (Left) and Multiple Unit Stacked Townhouses (Right)\nRM-8AN zones are located along arterials and therefore contain more robust acoustic requirements than the RM-8A zones. Since 29th Avenue is classified as a local street and not an arterial, the proposed rezoning is to the RM-8A District Schedule.\nHousing Needs Report (2022) – On April 27, 2022, Council resolved at a public meeting to receive a Housing Needs Report (HNR) prepared by staff. Further to the BC Provincial government’s requirement, Council must consider the most recent HNR when developing a development plan, or when amending a development plan in relation to Council’s housing policies respecting affordable housing, rental housing and special needs housing.\nThis zoning amendment would facilitate the delivery of strata housing and implements Council-approved direction contained in the Plan, which includes direction on housing that is well supported by the data and findings within the HNR.\nStrategic Analysis\n1. Simplified Rezoning Process\nRezoning to an RM-8A/AN follows a simplified rezoning process. Since this rezoning is to an established District Schedule which sets out the allowable uses, maximum heights and densities, architectural drawings are not required at the rezoning stage. The rezoning review is limited to a plan amendment to the Zoning and Development By-law to designate the site from R1-1 to RM-8A (see Appendix A).\nStaff review drawings according to the RM-8A/AN design guidelines at a future development permit process which streamlines the rezoning process.\nAn Urban Design Panel review is not required due to the small scale of the buildings and comprehensive design guidelines that accompany the District Schedule.",

The site area is approximately 746.2 sq. m (8,032 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 17.1 m (56 ft.) along 30th Avenue and a depth of 43.8 m (144 ft.) along the east property line.\nThe site and area to the east are zoned R1-1 and developed with single-detached houses. Surrounding sites have been rezoned to RM-8A and the BC Children’s Hospital to the west is zoned CD-1. The area is eligible for rezoning to RM-8A under the Plan.\nThe house on the subject property was constructed in 1949 and is not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register. As a single-lot development with secondary rental, the Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy does not apply.\nFigure 1: Location Map – Site and Context\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land-use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The site is located within the Plan which is in alignment with the Vancouver Plan.\nCambie Corridor Plan – The Plan guides the transformation of the Corridor into an area where people can live, work, shop, play and learn – all within close proximity to the Canada Line. The Corridor’s population is anticipated to double by 2041, with 30,000 new homes, making it one of the largest growth areas outside of downtown.\nThe Plan identifies over 1,100 detached lots as eligible to redevelop for townhouses, creating opportunities for approximately 8,200 units of much-needed ground-oriented housing.\nSpecifically, Section 4.2.9 of the Plan supports residential townhouses or rowhouses for up to three storeys and a maximum density of 1.20 FSR.\nThe subject site is located within the Queen Elizabeth neighbourhood, characterized by its existing low-density residential character and green park-like setting.\nDesign Guidelines – The RM-8A/AN Districts Schedule is accompanied by clear design guidelines. These guidelines establish form of development expectations which provide predictability and certainty for new buildings. Design criteria sets out expected typologies, requirements for family housing, access to sunlight, privacy, landscape treatment, along with flexible development options for smaller lots (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2: Form of Development per the Design Guidelines – (Courtyard Rowhouses (Left) and Multiple Unit Stacked Townhouses (Right)\nRM-8AN zones are located along arterials and therefore contain more robust acoustic requirements than the RM-8A zones. Since 30th Avenue is classified as a local street and not an arterial, the proposed rezoning is to the RM-8A District Schedule.\nHousing Needs Report (2022) - On April 27, 2022, Council resolved at a public meeting to receive a Housing Needs Report (HNR) prepared by staff. Further to the BC Provincial government’s requirement, Council must consider the most recent HNR when developing a development plan, or when amending a development plan in relation to Council’s housing policies respecting affordable housing, rental housing and special needs housing.\nThis zoning amendment would facilitate the delivery of strata housing and implements Council-approved direction contained in the Plan, which includes direction on housing that is well supported by the data and findings within the HNR.\nStrategic Analysis\n1. Simplified Rezoning Process\nRezoning to an RM-8A/AN follows a simplified rezoning process. Since this rezoning is to an established Districts Schedule which sets out the allowable uses, maximum heights and densities, architectural drawings are not required at the rezoning stage. The rezoning review is limited to a plan amendment to the Zoning and Development By-law to designate the site from R1-1 to RM-8A (see Appendix A).\nStaff review drawings according to the RM-8A/AN design guidelines at a future development permit process, which streamlines the rezoning process.\nAn Urban Design Panel review is not required due to the small scale of the buildings and comprehensive design guidelines that accompany the District Schedule.",

Site and Context\nThe subject site (see Figure 1) is comprised of one legal parcel fronting 49th Avenue. The total site area is approximately 1,073 sq. m (11,547 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 20.2 m (66 ft.) along 49th Avenue and a depth of 53.4 m (175 ft.).\nFigure 1: Location Map – Site and Context\nThis property and the surrounding area are zoned for residential uses under the R1-1 District Schedule. The site is currently an empty lot and contains no rental tenancies.\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The approved Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The proposal addresses priorities within the Housing Vancouver Strategy which aligns with the Vancouver Plan.\nSecured Rental Policy (“SRP”) – The SRP encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing in Vancouver. Updates to the SRP were approved by Council in December 2021 to streamline the delivery of new rental housing. These included clarifying opportunities for rezoning in low-density areas close to public transit, shopping and other daily needs, and to streamline and simplify the rezoning process by utilizing new rental zones with standardized regulations.\nThe SRP outlines the following locational eligibility criteria for sites in low-density areas:\n• In an existing R1-1 or RT zone outside of recent community plan areas (excluding certain RT-zoned areas in Kitsilano and Kensington-Cedar Cottage with high proportions of heritage buildings and multiple conversion dwellings);\n• Located within close proximity to public transit and local shopping; and\n• On the first full block on either side of an eligible arterial road.\nSites that meet these criteria and that are part of the typical street grid (including having lane or secondary street access to the rear) and are regular in shape, size and other attributes may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the residential rental zones. The applicable option or options are further informed by the site’s size, orientation and adjacent context.\nThe SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under the SRP for five-storey buildings.\nRR Zoning District Schedules and Design Guidelines – Along with updates to the SRP, in December 2021 Council approved the addition of new residential rental (“RR”) zoning district schedules to the Zoning & Development By-law: “RR-1”, “RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C”, and “RR-3A and RR-3B”. Like other standard zoning districts, the RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed.\nFurther direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines. Recognizing that the SRP and RR zones are intended to enable incremental change in neighbourhoods that currently consist primarily of detached houses and duplexes, the guidelines support new missing middle buildings that foster neighbourliness and social connection, and contribute to an evolving streetscape which accommodates more architectural variety and diversity of housing options.\nHousing Vancouver Strategy – In November 2017, Council approved the Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027). The strategy seeks to shift the supply of new homes toward the right supply, with targets for new units along a continuum of housing types. The Housing",

Site and Context\nThe subject site (see Figure 1) is comprised of four legal parcels fronting West 41st Avenue. The total site area is approximately 1,994.2 sq. m (21,466 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 50.6 m (166 ft.) along 41st Avenue and a depth of 39.2 m (129 ft.).\nFigure 1: Location Map – Site and Context\nThe site is currently zoned R1-1 and developed with four single-detached homes constructed between 1948 and 1961. The properties are not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register. The property contains four rental tenancies and the tenant protection policy does apply. The surrounding area is zoned for residential (R1-1 and RT-11). CD-1 (3A) (Orchard Park Senior’s Housing) to the south is developed with rental housing up to three storeys.\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The approved Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The proposal addresses priorities within the Housing Vancouver Strategy which aligns with the Vancouver Plan.\nSecured Rental Policy (“SRP”) – The SRP encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing in Vancouver. Updates to the SRP were approved by Council in December 2021 to streamline the delivery of new rental housing. These included clarifying opportunities for rezoning in low-density areas close to public transit, shopping and other daily needs, and to streamline and simplify the rezoning process by utilizing new rental zones with standardized regulations.\nThe SRP outlines the following locational eligibility criteria for sites in low-density areas:\n• In an existing R1-1 or RT zone outside of recent community plan areas (excluding certain RT-zoned areas in Kitsilano and Kensington-Cedar Cottage with high proportions of heritage buildings and multiple conversion dwellings);\n• Located within close proximity to public transit and local shopping; and\n• On the first full block on either side of an eligible arterial road.\nSites that meet these criteria and that are part of the typical street grid (including having lane or secondary street access to the rear) and are regular in shape, size and other attributes may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the new residential rental zones. The applicable option or options are further informed by the site’s size, orientation and adjacent context.\nThe SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under SRP for five-storey buildings.\nRR Zoning District Schedules and Design Guidelines – Along with updates to the SRP, in December 2021 Council approved the addition of new residential rental (“RR”) zoning district schedules to the Zoning & Development By-law: “RR-1”, “RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C”, and “RR-3A and RR-3B”. Like other standard zoning districts, the RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs.\nAll residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed.\nFurther direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines. Recognizing that the SRP and RR zones are intended to enable incremental change in neighbourhoods that currently consist primarily of detached houses and duplexes, the guidelines",

A location map and aerial photo of the subject site are provided in Attachment 1.\nFindings of Fact\nA Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is provided in Attachment 2.\nExisting Site Condition and Context\nA survey of the subject site is included in Attachment 3. The subject site consists of two lots located on the east side of No. 1 Road, between Blundell Road and Coldfall Road.\nSubject Site Existing Housing Profile\nThe subject site consists of two lots, each containing a single-family dwelling that is tenant occupied. The existing dwellings are proposed to be demolished. The applicant has indicated that the tenants are aware of the redevelopment proposal and the applicant will ensure compliance with the Residential Tenancy Act.\nSurrounding Development\nExisting development immediately surrounding the subject site is as follows:\nTo the North: Are three lots, two with newer construction zoned “Compact Single Detached (RC1)” and one zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”, each containing a single-family dwelling.\nTo the South: Is a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”, containing a single-family dwelling. Beyond that is a large lot zoned “Low Density Townhouses (RTL4)”, containing 28 townhouses.\nTo the East: Are lots zoned “Single Detached (RS1/B)”, each containing a single-family dwelling fronting Corless Place.\nTo the West: Across No. 1 Road are compact lots zoned “Single Detached (RS1/K)” and “Compact Single Detached (RC1)”, each containing a single-family dwelling.\nPLN - 8\nOctober 25, 2023 - 3 - RZ 21-945869\n7401059\nRelated Policies & Studies\nOfficial Community Plan\nThe Official Community Plan (OCP) land use designation for the subject properties is “Neighbourhood Residential”. This redevelopment proposal is consistent with this designation.\nArterial Road Land Use Policy\nLand Use Designation\nThe Arterial Road Land Use Policy designation for the subject properties is “Arterial Road Townhouse”, subject to the development criteria in the Policy. This redevelopment proposal is consistent with this designation.\nLot Width and Residual Lots\nThe development criteria for townhouses in the Arterial Road Land Use Policy call for land assembly with a minimum 50 m frontage on a major arterial road and avoiding the creation of residual sites with less than a 50 m frontage. The Policy also recognizes that land assembly with existing narrow lots or on lots containing newer dwellings will be difficult to redevelop. The Policy provides flexibility for the minimum frontage in these circumstances provided the application can meet other guidelines and requirements. This includes the ability to consolidate vehicle access points and securing shared access by means of a Statutory Right-of-Way (SRW) agreement to adjacent properties to enable their potential redevelopment in the future.\nAlthough this redevelopment proposal involves land assembly with a frontage less than 50 m on No. 1 Road (i.e., 40 m), staff support the application for the following reasons:\nx The applicant has provided documentation indicating that efforts have been made in 2021 and 2023 to acquire the property to the south at 8180 No. 1 Road in order to achieve the minimum arterial road frontage width of 50 m, but that the owner is not interested in redeveloping their property at this time.\nx Due to existing newer development and unique lot geometry immediately north of the subject site, the applicant has indicated that it is not financially feasible to pursue land assembly with those properties as part of this redevelopment proposal.\nx The applicant has submitted a preliminary concept plan to show how the neighbouring properties to the north and south could redevelop in the future with shared vehicle access through the subject site (a copy of which is on file).\nx Prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw, the applicant must register a SRW agreement on Title for public right-of-passage over the entire drive-aisle and on-site truck turnaround area opposite the site entry to secure future shared access to sites to the south and north. The SRW agreement is to contain language to indicate that the on-site truck turnaround area opposite the site entry can be removed from the SRW area and used as additional outdoor amenity space for the sole use of the subject development when the adjacent property to the south is redeveloped for townhouses and on-site truck turnaround is accommodated by creating a T-intersection of the drive-aisles on the lots.\nPLN - 9",

Ltd. (Balraj Singh Sanghera and Rajbir Kaur Chatha), to rezone 11831/11833 Seabrook Crescent from the “Single Detached (RS1/E)” zone to the “Single Detached (RS2/B)” zone in order to permit the property to be subdivided into two single-family lots, each with vehicle access from Seabrook Crescent. A location map and aerial photo are provided in Attachment 1. The proposed subdivision plan and draft site plan are provided in Attachment 2.\nFindings of Fact\nA Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached (Attachment 3).\nSubject Site Existing Housing Profile\nThe subject site contains an existing un-stratified non-conforming duplex (two-unit dwelling), which will be demolished prior to subdivision. Both dwelling units are currently tenant occupied and do not contain any secondary suites. The applicant has indicated that the tenants are aware of the redevelopment proposal and the applicant will ensure compliance with the Residential Tenancy Act.\nSurrounding Development\nDevelopment immediately surrounding the site is as follows:\nTo the North: A single-family houses on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”.\nTo the South: A single-family houses on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”.\nTo the East: Across the lane, an existing duplex on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)” fronting onto No. 5 Road. There is a Rezoning application and Development Permit (RZ 22-019002/DP 23-028942) at 10111/10113 No. 5 Road to permit the development of three front-back duplex lots. The rezoning application received third reading on October 16, 2023.\nTo the West: Across Seabrook Crescent, an existing duplex on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”.\nRelated Policies & Studies\nOfficial Community Plan\nThe subject site is designated as “Neighbourhood Residential” in the Official Community Plan (OCP). This proposal is consistent with this OCP designation.\nPLN - 40\nOctober 23, 2023 - 3 - RZ 22-010976\n7409688\nSingle-Family Lot Size Policy 5434/ Zoning Bylaw 8500\nThe subject property is located within the area covered by Lot Size Policy 5434, adopted by City Council in 1990, amended in 1991 and 2006 (Attachment 4). The Policy permits a majority of lots within the Policy Area (including the subject property) to be rezoned and subdivided in accordance with the provisions of the “Single Detached (RS1/E)” zone.\nThe subject site is currently occupied by a legal duplex. Section 2.3.7 of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 provides that the Lot Size Policy does not apply to a rezoning that a legal duplex and which are intended to be subdivided into no more than two single-family lots. The proposed rezoning and subdivision complies with Section 2.3.7 and would result in the creation of two single-family lots being 444.9 m2 and 450.2 m2 in area. Further, the proposed rezoning and subdivision would comply with the minimum lot dimensions and size applicable to the “Single Detached (RS2B)” zone.\nMinistry of Transportation & Infrastructure Approval\nAs the subject site is located within 800 m of an intersection of a Provincial Limited Access Highway and a City road, this redevelopment proposal was referred to the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MOTI) for review and comment. Preliminary confirmation has been received from MOTI indicating that they have no objections to the proposed redevelopment.

The proposed subdivision plan and site plan are provided in Attachment 2.\nFindings of Fact: A Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached (Attachment 3).\nSubject Site Existing Housing Profile: This site is currently occupied by an existing duplex (two-family) dwelling, which will be demolished prior to subdivision. The existing two-family dwelling is owner-occupied and does not contain any secondary suites.\nSurrounding Development: Development immediately surrounding the site is as follows: To the North: An existing strata-titled duplex on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”. To the South: Existing single detached houses on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”. To the East: An existing strata-titled duplex on a lot zoned “Two-Unit Dwellings (RD1)”.

This proposal is consistent with both of those land use designations. Floodplain Management Implementation Strategy: The proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204.

Should the Planning Committee endorse this application and Council grant first reading to the rezoning bylaw, the bylaw will be forwarded to a Public Hearing, where any area resident or interested party will have an opportunity to comment. Public notification for the Public Hearing will be provided as per the Local Government Act and the City’s Zoning Bylaw 8500.\nAnalysis: Proposed Rezoning and Subdivision: The applicant is proposing to rezone the subject site and subdivide it into two single-family lots, each with a secondary suite, with access from Bonavista Gate. This development proposal is consistent with development in the area. The proposed subdivision plan and site plan are shown in Attachment 2. Staff worked with the applicant to modify the building envelope to enable retention of trees on site at the front and rear of the property. Existing Legal Encumbrances: There is a 3.0 m wide Statutory Right-of-Way (SRW) in the backyard along the eastern property line for sanitary sewer utility purposes. The applicant has been advised that encroachment into the SRW is not permitted. A City Covenant is registered on both 10840 and 10860 Bonavista Gate Titles that restrict the development to a duplex, therefore, the duplex covenants must be discharged from Title prior to the final adoption of the rezoning bylaw. There is a Land Tax Deferment Act Agreement currently registered on the 10840 Bonavista Gate Title (proposed Lot A), which allows the property owner to defer the payment of taxes. All deferred taxes must be paid and the agreement must be discharged from Title prior to the preparation and registration of any legal documents associated with this rezoning application. Transportation and Site Access: Vehicle access is proposed to be from Bonavista Gate for both of the proposed lots. The existing driveways will be removed and new driveways will be constructed as detailed in the Site Servicing and Frontage Improvements sub-section of this report. Two parking spaces will be provided for each dwelling unit in the garage.\nPH - 113",

Staff have not received any comments from the public about the rezoning application in response to the early public notification or placement of the rezoning sign on the property.\nShould the Planning Committee endorse this application and Council grant first reading to the rezoning bylaw, the bylaw will be forwarded to a Public Hearing, where any area resident or interested party will have an opportunity to comment.\nPublic notification for the Public Hearing will be provided as per the Local Government Act and the City’s Zoning Bylaw 8500.\nAnalysis\nThis redevelopment proposes to rezone and subdivide an existing single-family lot into two new single-family lots with vehicular access for both new lots off Lassam Road. This rezoning and subdivision is consistent with the emerging lot fabric and vehicular access along Lassam Road.\nExisting Legal Encumbrances\nThere is an existing 3 m wide Statutory Right-of-Way (SRW) for City sanitary service that covers a small portion of the property in the southwest corner which will be expanded and widened northward with utility upgrades. The applicant has been advised that no building encroachment into the SRW is permitted.\nTransportation and Site Access\nThe subject site currently has vehicular access from a driveway letdown along Lassam Road. In accordance with the Residential Lot (Vehicular) Access Regulation Bylaw 7222, vehicle access to proposed Lot 1 and proposed Lot 2 will be from Lassam Road.\nPLN - 9",
