Applicant’s Comments
Michael Cheung, Spectra Design, provided an overview of the application, highlighting the following:
§
the proposed 17-unit townhouse development is located in a prominent corner and has been designed to provide a gateway feel;

In addition, Ms. Chan noted that (i) on-site sustainability features include soft landscaping and installation of permeable pavers in certain areas throughout the site, (ii) proposed plant species to be planted are low maintenance, drought tolerant and have habitat value for small birds and pollinators, and (iii) lighting is provided along the street frontage and pedestrian walkways.
In reply to queries from the Panel, the project’s design team acknowledged that each townhouse unit is provided with a private outdoor space on the ground level and a balcony on the second level.

Applicant’s Comments
Scott Douglas, Kasian Architecture Interior Design and Planning Ltd., with the aid of a visual presentation (attached to and forming part of these Minutes as [Schedule 2](https://citycouncil.richmond.ca/__shared/assets/Sched_2_DPP_10301954871.pdf)) provided background information on the proposed development and reviewed its site context, proposed vehicle and pedestrian entries and circulation, form and character, and building lay-out.
Mr. Douglas highlighted that (i) on-site signage will be installed to direct customers to their intended destination, (ii) the installation of skylight and use of glass material on ground level will introduce daylight into some areas of the building, (iii) a height variance is requested for the principal building, and (iv) the shadow study indicates minimal shadow impact of the building to the Richmond Nature Park to the west of the subject site.
Mary Chan-Yip, PMG Landscape Architects, with the aid of a visual presentation (attached to and forming part of these Minutes as [Schedule 3](https://citycouncil.richmond.ca/__shared/assets/Sched_3_DPP_10301954872.pdf)) briefed the Panel on the main landscaping features of the proposed development, noting that (i) the proposed landscape design considered the existing on-site landscaping and design guidelines of the Richmond Auto Mall Association (RAMA), (ii) proposed new plantings in prominent locations within the subject site will enhance the street edge and provide visual interest, (iii) 13 existing trees on-site and in the boulevard along Smallwood Place will be retained, and (iv) 14 replacement trees are proposed to be planted on-site.
Ms. Chan further noted that (i) a high-efficiency irrigation system is proposed, (ii) public pedestrian connections will be provided on the site consistent with the updated overall RAMA public realm design, and (iii) permeable pavers will be installed in certain areas on the site for stormwater mitigation.
Staff Comments
Mr. Craig noted that (i) the proposed building height, rear yard setback and loading variances were identified at the rezoning stage and no changes in requested variances were made since rezoning, (ii) the proposed variances are consistent with similar variances that have been granted in projects within the Richmond Auto Mall, (iii) the principal building has been designed to be 15 percent more energy efficient than the base line model as per the BC Building Code requirements, (iv) a legal agreement will be secured as a condition prior to Development Permit issuance to ensure compliance with the building’s targeted energy performance level, and (v) five electric vehicle charging stations will be provided on-site and secured through the Development Permit process.
Panel Discussion
In reply to queries from the Panel, the project’s design team noted that (i) as indicated in the shadow study, the potential worst-case scenario is that the proposed principal building will cast a shadow on a small portion of the Nature Park for only a brief period of time at sunrise during the winter solstice in December, (ii) there were no bird strikes reported by auto dealerships within the Richmond Auto Mall, (iii) a post-construction weekly monitoring of bird strikes will be conducted on-site by a Registered Professional Biologist for a period of 12 months, and (iv) the use of glazing on the ground level of the building and the absence of landscaping close to the building will mitigate the potential for bird strikes.
In reply to further queries from the Panel, the design team advised that (i) the proposed single-storey accessory building is located adjacent to the car wash facility of the adjacent auto dealership to the east, (ii) a total of 9 trees located on-site and in the boulevard along Smallwood Place will be removed, (iii) new plantings on-site are consistent with the RAMA guidelines, and (iv) the proposed on-site electric vehicle charging stations are located in front of the principal building and are available for public use.
